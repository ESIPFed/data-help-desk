# Roles to Fill

## Organizing committee for data help desk

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Form an organizing committee**
    - with 5-10 key individuals committed to the success of the event.
    - If the meeting the Data Help Desk is associated with has a certain domain
    focus, it is best to engage a group of organizers who are experts in that
    area.
    - It's essential to have a dedicated core group of organizers who meet
    regularly for planning and advertising purposes.

1.  **Create a general plan**
    - Agree on a general plan for the event to get started and revisit.

1.  **Establish contacts**
    -   Have established and active relationships with key contacts at the
        organization hosting the meeting.
    -   For example, a good relationship with key personnel at AGU along with

        executing, and maximizing the impact of each event held together at
        an AGU Fall Meeting.
    -   Engage with the meeting host & other organizers very early on in the
        planning process.

what their respective roles will be.

   - Works with the Question Referrer to ensure that all questions asked
   on BlueSky using the hashtag #DataHelpDesk are addressed.
   - Online media like
   BlueSky is a great place to create a buzz and host discussion during Data
   Help Desk events.

## Staffing for key tasks & roles

The size of an event, including the number of volunteers, anticipated
attendance, and length of event, should determine how many individuals are
needed to perform key tasks.

Find commonalities with researchers (users of the data desk) – sharing not just
informatics, but also science expertise of volunteers is important for
establishing trust and starting conversations.

These do not all have to be done by different people, but are somewhat discrete
tasks:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. **Data Help Desk Designer**
    - An individual who is responsible for the overarching vision of each event in
collaboration with a small dedicated organizing committee composed of
representatives from all major organizing entities. Serves in all other roles
below or delegates them to other individuals.

1. **Meeting Host Liaison**
    - An individual who works especially close with the meeting host team to promote
the virtual event on the meeting website, in the meeting program, and in regular
communications about the event. The Meeting Host Liaison will also explore and
pursue additional ways to increase the visibility of the event in collaboration
with the meeting host team, including blog posts, social media promotion, and
more.

1. **Volunteers**
    - For smaller events, it may be best to hand-pick a set of volunteers, as working
with experts prior to the event is often one of the most time-consuming (and
rewarding) tasks associated with a Data Help Desk.
    - You can also share a volunteer form (e.g., Google Form) with relevant mailing
lists to solicit volunteers. Past volunteers should also be invited.

1. **Expert Volunteers**
    - An individual who volunteers to a) monitor questions asked during a Data Help Desk and provide responses; and/or b) share resources related to making data and/or software more open and FAIR.
    - Experts should not talk down to researchers, but instead explain how they came
to understand why, for example, it’s important to have sound data management
practices.
    - Expertise with
        - How to analyze data
        - Familiarity with specific datasets or domain knowledge
        - How to visualize data
        - How to find relevant data

1. **Volunteer Coordinator**
    - An individual who manages the process of recruiting and supporting expert
volunteers by providing guidance on how to contribute and other support before
and during the Data Help Desk.

1. **Question Referrer**
    - An individual who monitors BlueSky and any other platforms where researchers may
contribute questions, who quickly refers these questions to experts who may be
able to address the queries.
    - This could mean sharing a question asked in Twitter on a Slack channel or
retweeting and tagging an expert or even referring the researcher to a specific
person via email.
    - The Question Referrer’s job is to make sure that all questions are addressed in
some way.

1. **Website Manager**
    - An individual who manages the main event website, including the event
description, sponsor/organizer acknowledgement, and information on how to
participate, along with the gallery of contributed resources.

1. **Workshop Coordinator**
    - An individual who develops and coordinates any workshops or more in-depth side
events happening in conjunction with the Data Help Desk on broad topics like how
to create a data management plan, how to cite datasets, code, and software, and
how to find an appropriate data repository.
    - The most challenging aspect of this role is finding the right presenters for
these workshops, those who have the right expertise and who are willing to
devote the time to leading and drawing a sizable crowd.
