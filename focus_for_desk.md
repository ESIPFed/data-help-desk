# Focus of a Data Help Desk

The primary focus of a data help desk is to provide researchers with
opportunities to engage with informatics experts who are familiar with their
scientific domain. This engagement is intended to help researchers learn about
skills and techniques that will further their research and make their data and
software more open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

In essence, the data help desk focuses on empowering researchers with the
knowledge and resources needed to effectively manage their data, embrace open
science principles, and make their research more accessible and impactful.

Here are some key aspects of the focus of a data help desk:

-   **Answering Data-Related Questions:** The help desk is a place where
    researchers can ask questions about any aspect of Earth science data,
    including finding, sharing, analyzing, publishing, and citing data and
    software. This includes questions about dealing with large datasets or model
    data, and which data to archive.
-   **Promoting FAIR Principles:** A significant focus is on educating
    researchers about FAIR data principles and assisting them in making their
    research outputs FAIR. This includes explaining what FAIR means and how to
    implement these principles.
-   **Facilitating Open Science:** The help desk aims to support the ecological
    community's adoption of open science practices and help researchers meet
    publisher or funder expectations for open data and software. It operates
    within the Open Science Pavilion at some conferences.
-   **Providing Information on Data Management:** The desk offers guidance on
    various aspects of data management, such as creating data management plans,
    data citation, and finding suitable data repositories.
-   **Demonstrating Tools and Resources:** The help desk often includes
    demonstrations of relevant tools and platforms that researchers can use to
    manage their data and enhance their research. This can involve on-demand
    demos or a gallery of recorded demos and tutorials.
-   **Connecting Researchers with Experts:** It serves as a point of contact
    where researchers can connect with informatics experts and receive guidance
    tailored to their scientific domain.
-   **Addressing Community Needs:** The data help desk helps identify and
    address the data-related needs of the research community, such as acquiring,
    cleaning, archiving, and citing data, as well as understanding FAIR
    principles.
-   **Supporting Various Knowledge Levels:** Recognizing that many researchers
    have little or no formal training in research data management, the help desk
    aims to cater to various knowledge levels.
