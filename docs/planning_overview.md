# Planning a data help desk

By following these steps, you can set up a successful data help desk that not
only addresses immediate data management concerns but also contributes to a
broader culture of open data practices within the research community. You can
create a comprehensive data help desk that effectively assists users in
navigating the complexities of data archiving and management. This setup will
not only address immediate questions but also promote best practices in
long-term data stewardship.

## Overview

Setting up a data help desk involves several strategic steps that ensure
effective support for researchers and users seeking data management guidance.
Here’s a breakdown of the process:

### Define Your Target Audience

Identify who will benefit from the help desk. This could include graduate
students, researchers, or staff interested in data management.

### Define the Purpose and Scope

Begin by identifying the objectives of your data help desk. Clearly outline the
types of questions you aim to address, such as data storage options, metadata
requirements, and data sharing practices. As noted in the context, understanding
the types of inquiries often encountered (for example, where to archive data or
how to create a data management plan) is crucial in shaping the help desk’s
focus and ensuring it meets the needs of users.

Focus on common questions related to data storage and management. Specifically,
you might want to address:

Where to archive data

What metadata is needed

How to comply with data sharing requirements

Best practices for creating a data management plan

Create a collection of resources such as:

Data Management Plans

Explain the importance of having a data management plan and how it saves time
and ensures better data organization.

Metadata Creation

Provide guidance on what constitutes effective metadata, emphasizing that it
includes "data about data" which aids in data findability and understanding.
Reference resources that outline metadata standards and best practices.

Consider FAIR Principles

Ensure that your help desk supports the FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles throughout the help desk's
operation. Encourage users to think about how to make their data compliant with
these principles when choosing an archiving solution.

### Assemble a Team of Experts

Recruit knowledgeable volunteers or staff who can provide accurate and helpful
responses. This team may consist of librarians, data management specialists, and
researchers with experience in data handling. You can also engage with academic
institutions or professional societies to find individuals willing to contribute
their expertise (as highlighted in the
[Data Management RoadMap](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14384456.v1)).
Clear communication with your team about their roles and responsibilities will
create a cohesive support system.

### Choose a Platform and Set Up Infrastructure

Decide on how to deliver the help desk services. Will it be a physical presence
at conferences, a virtual service, or a combination of both? Establishing a
digital platform (such as a website, social media accounts, or chat service)
where users can ask questions in real-time can increase accessibility. According
to the Virtual Data Help Desk Planning Tips, using various channels like Twitter
or private survey forms can facilitate user engagement.

### Promote Communication Channels

Use platforms such as a dedicated Slack channel or social media (e.g., a hashtag
like #DataHelpDesk) to facilitate real-time questions and answers. This approach
was successfully employed at various data help desks, allowing for quick
responses and resource sharing.

### Promote the Help Desk

Effectively communicate the existence and purpose of the help desk to your
target audience. Utilize social media, email, and academic networks to inform
potential users about the services offered. Promote upcoming sessions, available
experts, or specific topics that will be discussed. Incorporating signage during
in-person events and clear online visuals can enhance user awareness.

### Gather Feedback and Revise

After launching your data help desk, collecting user feedback is essential for
continuous improvement. Use surveys to assess user satisfaction, common queries,
and areas for enhancement. Based on this feedback, update your resources, tweak
staffing arrangements, and modify outreach efforts accordingly. Engaging in this
cycle will ensure that the help desk evolves to meet the changing needs of its
users effectively.

Maintain a repository of frequently asked questions and expert responses that
can serve as a resource for future inquiries.

## More detailed steps

By incorporating structured planning along with feedback mechanisms, you can
create a robust and effective data help desk that significantly aids researchers
in navigating data management challenges.
