2. **Data management and curation**:
    - How do I create a data package or archive?
    - What metadata standards should I use for my data?
    - How do I ensure data quality and integrity?
3. **Repository and storage options**:
    - Which repositories are available for storing my data?
    - What are the requirements for data storage and access?
    - Can I store sensitive or confidential data in the repository?
4. **Data sharing and collaboration**:
    - How do I share my data with others?
    - What are the best practices for collaborating on datasets?
    - Can I request access to someone else's data?

## Who is using output of a data help desk: Students, postdocs, early career, established scientists

The output of a data help desk can be used by various stakeholders across
different levels of researchers. Here's a breakdown of who might use the output:

**Students (Undergraduate and Graduate)**:

1. **Research assistants**: Students working on research projects may benefit
   from the data help desk's guidance on data management, curation, and sharing.
2. **Lab members**: Students participating in lab experiments or research
   projects may need assistance with data organization, storage, and retrieval.
3. **Research project participants**: Students collecting and analyzing data for
   a research project may rely on the data help desk for advice on data quality,
   validation, and preservation.

**Postdocs (Postdoctoral Researchers)**:

1. **Independent researchers**: Postdocs working as independent researchers may
   use the data help desk to manage their own research projects, including data
   sharing and collaboration.
2. **Collaborators**: Postdocs participating in collaborative research projects
   may rely on the data help desk for guidance on data management, curation, and
   sharing with colleagues.
3. **Mentees**: Postdocs working under a senior researcher or PI may use the
   data help desk to seek advice on their own research projects.

**Early Career Researchers (Principal Investigators, Group Leaders)**:

1. **New researchers starting their first independent project**: Early career
   researchers may benefit from the data help desk's guidance on setting up and
   managing their own research projects.
2. **Established researchers seeking expertise**: Established researchers
   looking to expand their research portfolio or collaborate with others may use
   the data help desk for advice on data management, curation, and sharing.

**Established Scientists (Senior Researchers)**:

1. **Research group leaders**: Senior researchers leading established research
   groups may use the data help desk to manage complex research projects
   involving multiple datasets and collaborators.
2. **Collaborators with specific expertise**: Established scientists
   collaborating with others who have specific expertise in data management,
   curation, or sharing may rely on the data help desk for guidance.
3. **Mentors and advisors**: Senior researchers mentoring or advising junior
