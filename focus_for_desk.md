# Focus of a Data Help Desk

TODO: update this text to answer what is a data help desk

The primary focus of a data help desk is to provide researchers with
opportunities to engage with experts who are familiar with their scientific
domain. This engagement is intended to help researchers learn about skills and
techniques that will further their research and make their data and software
more open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

In essence, the data help desk focuses on empowering researchers with the
knowledge and resources needed to effectively manage their data, embrace open
science principles, and make their research more accessible and impactful.

## Here are some key aspects

1. **Answering Data-Related Questions:** The help desk is a place where
   researchers can ask questions about any aspect of Earth science data,
   including finding, sharing, analyzing, publishing, and citing data and
   software. This includes questions about dealing with large datasets or model
   data, and which data to archive.
1. **Promoting FAIR Principles:** A significant focus is on educating
   researchers about FAIR data principles and assisting them in making their
   research outputs FAIR. This includes explaining what FAIR means and how to
   implement these principles.
1. **Facilitating Open Science:** The help desk aims to support the ecological
   community's adoption of open science practices and help researchers meet
   publisher or funder expectations for open data and software. It operates
   within the Open Science Pavilion at some conferences.
1. **Providing Information on Data Management:** The desk offers guidance on
   various aspects of data management, such as creating data management plans,
   data citation, and finding suitable data repositories.
1. **Demonstrating Tools and Resources:** The help desk often includes
   demonstrations of relevant tools and platforms that researchers can use to
   manage their data and enhance their research. This can involve on-demand
   demos or a gallery of recorded demos and tutorials.
1. **Connecting Researchers with Experts:** It serves as a point of contact
   where researchers can connect with informatics experts and receive guidance
   tailored to their scientific domain.
1. **Addressing Community Needs:** The data help desk helps identify and address
   the data-related needs of the research community, such as acquiring,
   cleaning, archiving, and citing data, as well as understanding FAIR
   principles.
1. **Supporting Various Knowledge Levels:** Recognizing that many researchers
   have little or no formal training in research data management, the help desk
   aims to cater to various knowledge levels.
