# Resources

### How to present resources

In general, there is a growing need for Data Help Desk organizers to identify
the best way to present the resources, as well as which resources would be most
effective to feature for each event (e.g., marine resources are most important
to feature for Ocean Sciences Meeting, while other events may have a broader
scope).

**How to store and make gallery of resources available outside of meeting?**

Because the gallery is a long-lasting output of a Data Help Desk, which may
itself only be live for a few days a year, it is one of the most valuable
outputs with the potential to reach many more researchers throughout the year.

For this reason, the challenges highlighted here are some of the most pressing
to address for future Data Help Desks, particularly for virtual events.

## Data help desk gallery of resources

Designing, compiling, and presenting the Gallery of Resources

This gallery has been featured on the main Data Help Desk website for each event
(e.g., <http://bit.ly/DataHelpAGU20>) or, more recently, as a page linked on the
main website.

**Is this the content they want all in one place to reference and organized
differently?**

The gallery includes primarily short video recordings (typically hosted on
YouTube) and one-pagers (typically hosted on the ESIP Figshare Repository at
<https://esip.figshare.com/Data_Help_Desk>).

This gallery started at a modest size, but has now grown to nearly 100
contributions, making it difficult for researchers to navigate and drill down
into.

**Question**

100 contributors to just figshare and YouTube or more resources?

For some Data Help Desks, we have reduced the gallery to a tailored subset of
particularly-relevant content to try to deal with this.

**Ask to get this tailored subset of the data help desk gallery**
