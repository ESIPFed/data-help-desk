# Giving Acknowledgement to Sponsors & Volunteers

We have often called the data help desk a “program of X, Y, and Z” and further
supported by many other individuals and organizations. X, Y, and Z have
typically been ESIP, the meeting host (AGU, GSA, EGU) and EarthCube, the
organizations that sponsor and/or contribute major effort and resources to the
event.

Since the volunteer experts typically span a very wide range of institutions,
they are counted among the further supporters.

**After the event**,

thank the volunteers and follow-up on any lingering questions. Consider running
a post-event survey to gather volunteer feedback on how the events could be
enhanced in the future.
