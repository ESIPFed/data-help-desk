# Questions from users

1. The Data Help Desk highlighted our community’s areas of need, which continued
   efforts must address: acquiring data for student and/or research use; data
   cleaning, reshaping and merging; quality control strategies; guidelines for
   archiving a researcher’s own data; data citation via DOI; and reproducible
   workflows that incorporate scripting and version control.

2. Our general impression is that, regardless of career stage, most booth
   visitors learned data-related skills on their own with little or no formal
   training. This suggests that acquiring specific data skills and computational
   literacy remain major hurdles. Data management practices should be better
   integrated into all ecological research activities, and scientific meetings
   provide an appropriate venue to disseminate resources.

3. With one foot in the rapidly evolving world of information science, “data
   people” are already veterans of a responsive meeting style called the
   “unconference”, where the delegates themselves help set a session’s focus and
   agenda (Ingebretsen 2008, Sohn 2018). With cooperation from ESA in future
   meetings, the Data Help Desk can coordinate the sorts of unique activities
   2019 visitors asked for, and which are best met by small ad hoc sessions and
   serendipitous meetups integrated into a larger event.

## User Questions by Category

The Data Help Desk has highlighted several areas where researchers frequently
seek assistance. These needs underscore the importance of ongoing efforts to
provide support and resources in these areas. Notably, many attendees report
learning data-related skills independently, suggesting a need for better
integration of data management practices into research activities and accessible
training resources.

This compilation reflects the diverse needs of researchers engaging with data
and software and highlights the valuable role of Data Help Desks in providing
guidance and connecting users with relevant resources. The prevalence of
questions on data repositories, FAIR principles, and data management for large
datasets indicates key areas where the community seeks support.

Here are some of the frequently asked questions, categorized by topic:

**Finding Data**

-   Where can I find a certain type of data?
-   Where to find specific datasets?
-   Papers and repositories that include ML keyword/ tagging for discovery
-   Is there open data resource about traffic-related air pollution and cases of
    asthma and COPD available?
-   environmental health data, open data vs personal/health data

**Data Repositories and Storage**

-   What's a good repository for a certain type of data?
-   Where can I deposit my model (or other large) datasets?
-   Where can I archive my data?
-   Good platforms for storing data for soil infiltration
-   Odor community monitoring - cloud storage funding?
-   Can I just link to my data portal or do I need to put it in a repository (to
    comply with policies at AGU)?
-   Where can I deposit lightning data (domain-discipline repository)?
-   Resources for starting a data repository? Arctic ice data, based in Taiwan
-   Where to share simulation data, 1 - 2 TB? Institutional repository will only
    take observational data
-   Where to share hydrology data

**For repositories, specific questions include:**

-   What types of data does your repository accept?
-   Does the archive accept data from any funding stream, or just from
    NSF-funded projects (for example)?
-   Are there any restrictions on data that are accepted (e.g., data sets > 1 TB
    can't be accommodated, or repo won't accept model output)?
-   What metadata standard does your repository use?
-   What is the procedure by which a scientist submits metadata (e.g,, via Word
    template)
-   Are there personnel at the repository who can help a scientist get their
    data and metadata archived?
-   When should a researcher engage with your repository?
-   Does your repository offer any training opportunities?
-   What license(s) does the repository support?
-   How much does it cost to deposit a dataset in your repository?

**Data Management (General)**

-   What makes data #FAIR? And what is FAIR anyway?
-   Working with data among teams; encouraging best practices, defining sampling
    system before fieldwork, early adoption, IGSN
-   How to make data accessible to educators or people not in the specific field

**Data Citation and Attribution**

-   How can I cite a dataset?
-   Using data from other datasets (citing), data from different instruments,
    aeronomy, madrigal, CEDAR
-   How do I cite my data?
-   Software citation; reducing duplication?

**Data Publication**

-   How and where can I publish my data or software?
-   What if I don't want to share my data until I've published papers on it?
-   Looking for a low-cost publication/journal for climate modelling paper?
    Self-funded work

**Software (related to data)**

-   What kind of software do I need to share with my paper? Python packages?
-   Looking for help / policy documents to show legal team to share software
    externally
-   Sharing software publication requirements - NASA/OSTP mandate
-   Resources for code documentation
-   more resources on software documentation?
-   Should I be looking at software when I review papers? (This is difficult and
    takes time)

**FAIR Principles and Open Data**

-   What do FAIR and open really mean?
-   Better definition of 'accessible' in FAIR

**Data Management Plans (DMPs)**

-   How can I write a good data management plan (DMP)?

**Compliance with Funders and Publishers**

-   Details of requirements and demands from funding agencies and journal
    publishers, so I can develop procedures to square those with my (FFRDC,
    defense) employer's public release approval requirements. Software is
    especially thorny!
-   All these new policies! How do I comply with my funder and publisher
    requirements for my data and software?

**Data Visualization and Analysis**

-   Looking for resources for data visualization and geospatial analysis
-   Matplotlib: Would like to put grid lines \*behind\* data. "z order' or
    'axes-behind = True' not working"

**Working with Large Datasets**

-   Question about who can take 15 to 20 TB of cyclonic event data going back to
    the 90s.
-   Is it ok to share processed data (which is much smaller) or do I need to
    share the raw file (very large) version?

**Metadata**

-   Common questions about metadata encountered at a data help desk relate to
    its importance, standards, submission procedures, and what information to
    include. Here are some specific examples and areas of inquiry:
-   What is the definition or description of metadata? This suggests that some
    users may have a basic lack of understanding of what metadata entails.
-   Why is metadata important? When describing samples, it's important to
    provide rich metadata that describes basic characteristics. Taking time
    upfront to maximize this information will save time when reusing or sharing
    samples in the future.
-   What metadata standard does your repository use? Researchers need to know
    which standards are expected by different data repositories.
-   What is the procedure by which a scientist submits metadata (e.g., via Word
    template)? Users require practical guidance on how to actually provide
    metadata to a repository.
-   Are there personnel at the repository who can help a scientist get their
    data and metadata archived? This shows that some users need assistance with
    the technical aspects of metadata creation and submission.
-   What to document with metadata? This question highlights the need for
    clarity on the specific information that should be included as metadata.
-   What is good metadata? Consistent data formatting & descriptions help
    machines & humans better understand & reuse valuable data, emphasizing the
    role of good metadata.

**Computational Notebooks**

-   Notebooks Now! - what does that submission look like, Curvenote, ArXiv/Earth
    ArXiv integration for notebook pre-prints
-   Looking for notebooks for academic/teaching purposes; DeepNote
-   Notebooks Now! AGU open science initiatives, are we providing resources to
    provide an environment?
