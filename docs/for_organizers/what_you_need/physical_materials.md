# Physical & Digital Materials

Effective materials — both printed and digital — are key to a successful Data Help Desk. They help attract attention, provide useful information, and support volunteers in answering questions. This page outlines the kinds of materials you'll want to prepare and how they can be used strategically throughout the event.

Visit the [Docs & Templates section]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/for_organizers/docs_and_templates) for templates, examples, and editable versions of many of the materials described here.

## One-Pagers, Handouts and Postcards

**One-pagers** are focused, single-topic sheets that give attendees a quick introduction to key concepts like FAIR data, citing datasets, or creating a data management plan. These should be easy to browse at the desk and designed for attendees to take home for reference.

**Handouts** often come from partner organizations or tool providers and are usually branded materials — like brochures, flyers, or pamphlets — that explain specific software, services, or initiatives. They help connect attendees with external resources and communities.

**Postcards** are compact and visual, ideal for quick distribution. When they include your booth number, a short message, and a QR code linking to your website, they’re an easy way to drive awareness and traffic during the event.

## Question Forms

**Question forms** are a simple but important tool at the Help Desk. Volunteers or attendees can use them to submit questions — whether they want a follow-up later or prefer to submit questions quietly. They're especially useful when the desk is busy or a full response isn’t possible in the moment. Volunteers can also use these forms to log questions they’ve answered throughout the event. This helps organizers keep track of common topics and identify trends, which can inform future planning and resources.

Both a [digital version](http://sgiz.mobi/s3/Data-Help-Desk-Questions) and a [printed version]() are available, and if possible, a tablet or laptop can be set up at the desk to collect submissions electronically. Offering both paper and digital options gives the team multiple ways to track engagement.

## Stickers and Swag

Swag items like stickers, badge ribbons or even a candy bowl(!) can help draw attendees in and reinforce messaging. Other booths or demoers will often ask to leave their stickers at the desk as well, which can add to the variety and keep the space feeling active and shared.

## Slide Decks and Videos

If you have access to a monitor, a looping slide deck is a great way to highlight core concepts, example questions, or featured resources. Keep slides simple and visually engaging — just a few words per slide, with bold graphics. This rotating content helps draw attention and reinforces messaging without requiring a constant verbal explanation.

Short recorded videos or demos can also be incorporated into the display, shared via QR code, or hosted in your resource gallery for continued access.
