# To view content updates locally

You can either edit the pages using Visual Studio Code or a similar text editor
(not WORD) and then push them to GitHub to see the updates, or you can install
Jekyll on your computer and see the changes on a locally served website, and
then push the docs to GitHub to see the updates. Without Jekyll on your
computer, you can still preview what the markdown text will look like on GitHub
pages using the preview option in Visual Studio Code.

To view content updates on a website served on your computer, see the following
instructions for installation and commands needed.
