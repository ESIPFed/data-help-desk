# Presentation Topics

-   **General Data Management:** Users are often looking for a basic
    understanding of what data management entails and seek guidance on
    establishing sound data management practices for their research. They have
    broad questions about organizing, accessing, and working with their data
    effectively.
-   **Information Management:** Researchers are interested in how to effectively
    manage the information surrounding their data, including documentation,
    organization, and understanding the context of their scientific findings.
    This can involve strategies for tracking workflows and creating descriptions
    of projects from the start.
-   **Metadata:** A key area of interest is understanding metadata standards and
    learning how to create comprehensive metadata records that enhance the
    findability and reusability of their data. Users also inquire about the
    specific procedures for submitting metadata to repositories.
-   **Data Repositories:** There's significant interest in identifying
    appropriate repositories for depositing data, including various types like
    model outputs or large datasets. Users have specific questions about
    repository policies, accepted data formats, size limitations, costs, and
    available support for archiving data. Finding domain-specific repositories
    is also a common need.
-   **Ocean Data:** This topic caters to researchers working with marine science
    data who are interested in resources and best practices specific to finding,
    managing, visualizing, analyzing, and publishing oceanographic datasets.
-   **Data Visualization:** Users seek guidance on effective techniques and
    software for visualizing different types of data. They may have questions
    about specific tools or challenges in presenting their data visually, such
    as arranging elements in plots.
-   **Analysis:** Researchers are keen to learn about various data analysis
    tools and methodologies, particularly for handling and processing large or
    complex datasets. They may be interested in specific software packages or
    statistical techniques relevant to their field.
-   **Publication:** Users frequently ask about the process of publishing their
    data and software, including where to publish and how to meet the
    requirements of funders and journal publishers. Understanding open access
    options and associated fees is also a point of inquiry.
-   **R:** There is strong interest in leveraging the R programming language for
    various data-related tasks, such as data cleaning, manipulation, statistical
    analysis, and generating reproducible research. Users also look for
    resources tailored for R users in scientific contexts.
-   **R Studio:** For users familiar with R, presentations on leveraging the R
    Studio integrated development environment for enhanced productivity in data
    analysis, visualization, and report generation would be valuable.
-   **Python:** Similar to R, researchers want to learn how to use Python for
    data management, analysis, visualization, and potentially for developing
    shareable software. Resources and best practices for using Python in
    scientific workflows are relevant.
-   **GIS:** Users working with geospatial data are interested in understanding
    best practices for storing and managing GIS data formats like .shp and
    .geojson, as well as identifying nonproprietary alternatives for better
    interoperability.
-   **Satellite-dervied Data:** This topic likely attracts users who work with
    satellite-derived data and are interested in how to access, process,
    analyze, and visualize this specific type of Earth observation data.
-   **NOAA Data:** Researchers who utilize data from the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) would be interested in presentations
    covering how to find, access, and work with various NOAA datasets and
    resources.
-   **Data management:** Reinforcing the foundational aspect, this topic would
    cover core principles and best practices in data management, addressing
    questions about organization, accessibility, preservation, and overall data
    lifecycle management. Many users, especially those with little formal
    training, need basic awareness in this area.
-   **Git and Gitlab/Hub:** Researchers are increasingly interested in using
    version control systems like Git and platforms like GitLab and GitHub for
    managing their code and data, fostering collaboration, and ensuring
    reproducibility in their research workflows.
-   **Data processing workflows and pipelining:** Users seek to learn how to
    design and implement efficient and reproducible workflows for processing
    their data, potentially utilizing scripting languages and tools for creating
    automated pipelines.
-   **Functional programming:** For more advanced users, presentations on
    applying functional programming concepts and techniques in languages like R
    or Python for cleaner, more modular, and potentially more efficient data
    analysis could be of interest.
-   **Community Management:** Some researchers are interested in learning how to
    engage with broader open science communities and initiatives, including
    contributing to projects, collaborating with others, and staying informed
    about advancements in data sharing and management practices.
