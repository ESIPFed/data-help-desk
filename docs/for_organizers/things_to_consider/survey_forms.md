# Survey Forms

The survey could be administered immediately after the user's interaction with
the Data Help Desk (as an exit survey), or as a follow-up after the event. For
virtual help desks, a web-based form is a suitable method. Consider keeping the
survey concise to maximize participation.

It might also be beneficial to have a brief, optional survey available _before_
the interaction to understand users' initial questions and expectations, which
could help volunteers prepare and tailor their assistance. It's very easy to
create a survey using Google Forms and collect responses in Google Sheets. See

## The Importance of a User Survey

User satisfaction surveys are a powerful tool for data help desks, providing
valuable insights that help improve services, foster loyalty, and maintain a
competitive edge. They allow data help desks to understand user opinions,
identify areas for improvement, and enhance their reputation.

### Key Points:

1. **User Insights**: Surveys provide data help desks with a clear understanding
   of user thoughts and feelings, highlighting strengths and areas needing
   improvement.
2. **User Loyalty**: Giving users a platform to share feedback makes them feel
   valued, potentially increasing their loyalty to the brand.
3. **Improvement Roadmap**: Survey feedback acts as a guide for data help desks
   to identify areas for continuous improvement of services and demonstrations
   enhancements.
4. **Problem Prevention**: Early detection of issues through surveys allows data
   help desks to address problems before the next event.
5. **Reputation Boost**: Satisfied users are more likely to recommend the data
   help desk, improving its reputation.

## Best Practices:

To gather useful and actionable feedback, it's essential to follow best
practices when creating user satisfaction surveys. These tips ensure the survey
is effective, engaging, and respectful of users' time, ultimately leading to
valuable insights.

### Key Points:

1. **Keep it Short**: Aim for surveys that take no more than 5-10 minutes to
   complete.
2. **Be Clear and Specific**: Use straightforward, jargon-free questions to
   avoid confusion.
3. **Mix Question Types**: Use a variety of question formats (multiple-choice,
   rating scales, open-ended) to gather diverse feedback.
4. **Prioritize Important Questions**: Place critical questions at the beginning
   to avoid respondent fatigue.
5. **Ensure Anonymity**: Assure respondents their answers are anonymous to
   encourage honest feedback.
6. **Use Skip Logic**: Personalize the survey experience by directing
   respondents to relevant questions based on their answers.
7. **Test the Survey**: Test the survey with a small group to identify and fix
   potential issues before sending it to everyone.
8. **Offer Incentives**: Provide a small reward, like a discount or prize entry,
   to encourage participation.
9. **Follow Up on Feedback**: Inform users that their input is valued and
   outline any changes based on their suggestions.
10. **Analyze and Act**: Review the collected data, identify areas for
    improvement, and create an action plan to address them.

> finding, sharing, analyzing, publishing, and citing data). Please be as
> specific as possible.
