# Funding & Sponsorship

Engage With the Meeting Host & Other Organizers Very early on in the planning
process,

## Possible sources for Sponsorship and Funding

-   **Grants from Funding Agencies:** The Data Help Desk has been supported by
    grants, such as from NSF. The Data Management Training Clearinghouse, an
    ESIP-hosted project, was made possible by a grant from the U.S. Institute of
    Museum and Library Services (IMLS). Therefore, applying for grants from
    relevant funding agencies is a potential avenue for funding a data help
    desk.
-   **Professional Organizations and Societies:** Organizations like the Earth
    Science Information Partners (ESIP), the American Meteorological Society
    (AMS), the American Geophysical Union (AGU), and the European Geosciences
    Union (EGU) have either sponsored, supported, or been partners in running
    data help desks. These organizations can be direct sponsors or provide
    in-kind support, such as space at their meetings. EarthCube has also been a
    sponsor.
-   **Cost-Sharing Among Participating Organizations:** When planning a data
    help desk, it is possible to ask major participating organizations to split
    the costs. This involves clarifying the possible levels of involvement and
    contributions from each organization.
-   **ESIP Community Funding:** The ESIP community itself can provide funding
    support for initiatives like the Data Help Desk.
-   **Incentivizing Participation:** While not direct funding, allocating
    resources to incentivize volunteers (e.g., through recognition or small
    benefits) can contribute to the success of a data help desk. This might
    require some level of financial or in-kind support.

To secure funding and sponsorship, it is crucial to engage with potential
sponsors early in the planning process to clarify their roles and contributions.
Clearly defining what each sponsoring organization needs to do to have their
name recognized is also important.
