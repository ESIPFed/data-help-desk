# Location & infrastructure

## Locations for Data Help Desk

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. **Table or Workstation**
   - For in-person data help desks, a physical presence like a table or booth in a high-traffic area is essential. The Exhibit Hall of a conference is often a beneficial location for high visibility. The AMS booth (booth 523) was used for the in-person Data Help Desk at #AMS2023. Similarly, at AGU 2024, the Data Help Desk was hosted within the Open Science Pavilion within the Exhibit Hall.
   - This dedicated space allows users to easily approach and interact with the help desk staff to ask questions. Volunteers staffing the Data Help Desk booth can directly engage with attendees.
   - The workstation area might also need to accommodate monitors for displaying demos of tools and resources on-demand.
1. **Conference Center or Meeting Room**
   - While the immediate help desk interaction might occur at a table or virtual space, a conference center or meeting room can be necessary for hosting more formal sessions like training sessions, workshops, or talks by experts. These sessions can provide more in-depth learning opportunities on specific data management topics.
   - The Data FAIR often includes workshops and town halls in addition to the Data Help Desk booth. The Open Science & Data Help Desk at AGU 2024 featured a daily 'featured demonstration hour'.
   - These spaces allow for demos of tools and resources to a larger audience. Workshops can cover key topics like data citation or creating data management plans.

## Infrastructure

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. **Computers and software**
   - Laptops or desktops are indeed necessary for data help desk staff, both for in-person and virtual operations. For in-person desks, they allow staff to access online resources, demonstrate tools, and potentially record questions or feedback. For virtual desks, they are the primary interface for monitoring communication channels, answering questions, and managing online resources.
   - The data help desk aims to help researchers learn skills and techniques for better research and making data and software open and FAIR. To do this effectively, staff and volunteers should be familiar with a range of software relevant to data management and analysis. General data topics like Programming, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, and specific user questions are needs related to software like Python, Matplotlib.
   - Staff might use software for creating and sharing resources, such as one-pagers, demos, and tutorials. This could include presentation software, video recording/editing tools, and document creation software.
   - For virtual engagement, staff might utilize social media management tools like Tweetdeck or Buffer for scheduling and managing posts.
   - The use of a Slack channel (#datahelpdesk-experts) is recommended for backchannel conversation amongst experts and for those less comfortable with public platforms like X (formerly Twitter) to provide input. This suggests the need for staff to have access to and be familiar with such communication platforms.
   - In the context of virtual platforms for meetings, having a presence like a virtual exhibit booth might require using specific software or interfaces provided by the meeting host.
1. **Internet connection**
   - A reliable and fast internet connection is absolutely critical for a data help desk, especially for virtual and hybrid models. It is needed for:
       - Accessing online resources and documentation to answer user questions. This includes links to data repositories, FAIR principles information, data management planning tools, and software documentation.
       - Communicating with users virtually via platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Slack, email, or virtual meeting platforms.
       - Hosting and accessing the gallery of resources, which often includes videos on YouTube and documents on platforms like Figshare.
       - Demonstrating online tools and resources to users, whether in-person or through screen sharing in virtual settings.
       - Accessing and updating the data help desk website or virtual platform presence.
