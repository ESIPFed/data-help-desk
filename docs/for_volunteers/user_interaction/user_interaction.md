# User Interaction Overview

The level of detail required for answers and the amount of time a user interacts
with a help desk can vary depending on the complexity of their question, the
type of issue they're experiencing, and the level of support required.

## Level of detail for answers

The level of detail required from a data help desk will depend on the user's
needs and the complexity of their question. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Basic information**: Provide a brief explanation, point to relevant
   resources, or offer general guidance (e.g., "Check our Resources for more
   information.")
2. **Step-by-step solutions**: If you have knowledge about the user's question,
   you can give a detailed explanation, including specific steps and
   troubleshooting tips (e.g., "To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
   [insert steps].")
3. **Customized solutions**: Some users have specific domain questions that may
   not be part of the resources provided. Examples are locating a data
   repository that contains specific data the user asked about. In this case,
   you can refer the user to a slack channel or a data expert if you don't have
   an answer.

## Average user interaction time

1. **Simple questions**: 1-5 minutes (e.g., clarifying a question and pointing
   to a resource, communication channel, or data expert)
2. **Moderate issues**: 5 minutes to 20 minutes (e.g., overview explanation of
   how to resolve the issue)
3. **Complex problems**: More than 30 minutes (e.g., in depth explanation of the
   solution). In this case set up a future time to interact with an expert.
