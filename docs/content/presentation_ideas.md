# Presentation Ideas for a Data Help Desk

## One-pagers

We are also looking to point to any one-pagers that might help researchers with
finding, managing, visualizing, analyzing, publishing, or citing data or
software. Remember the goal of this event is to help researchers learn about
skills and techniques that will help them further their research and make their
data and software open and FAIR. We are also happy to share resources that you
have already made (even if they are longer than 1 page) as long as they are
within scope.

Here are some topics that have been used or suggested for one-pagers at data
help desks:

-   **Finding Data:** One-pagers on this topic aim to help researchers discover
    relevant datasets for their work. They might cover tools, platforms, and
    strategies for searching data repositories and other data sources. These
    resources could guide users on where to look for specific types of Earth
    science data.

-   **Managing Data:** These one-pagers provide guidance on best practices for
    organizing, documenting, and working with research data throughout its
    lifecycle. They can address topics like data organization, naming
    conventions, and general data management techniques.

-   **Visualizing Data:** Resources in this area focus on techniques and tools
    for effectively displaying research data. They might highlight specific
    software or methods for creating insightful visualizations.

-   **Analyzing Data:** One-pagers on data analysis can introduce researchers to
    different analytical approaches and software relevant to their domain. They
    might touch upon statistical tools or programming languages used for data
    analysis.

-   **Publishing Data:** These resources explain the process of making research
    data publicly available. They often cover where and how to publish data to
    meet funder and publisher requirements.

-   **Citing Data and Software:** A crucial topic, these one-pagers guide
    researchers on how to properly cite datasets and software in their
    publications. They might include examples of data citations and emphasize
    the importance of persistent identifiers like DOIs.

-   **Data Repositories:** One-pagers focused on data repositories provide
    information about where researchers can deposit their data. They may detail
    types of data accepted, restrictions, metadata standards, submission
    procedures, costs, and contact information for specific repositories like
    USAP-DC or the Research Data Archive at NCAR.

-   **FAIR Data Principles:** These resources explain the principles of
    Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data. They help
    researchers understand what makes data FAIR and how to implement these
    principles in their work.

-   **Data Management Plans (DMPs):** One-pagers on DMPs guide researchers
    through the process of creating effective data management plans, often
    required by funders.

-   **Specific Data Platforms and Tools:** Some one-pagers highlight specific
    resources like OpenAQ for air quality data, EarthCube resources for FAIR
    implementation, BCO-DMO for oceanographic data, and SeedMeLab as a
    scientific data management platform. Others might focus on tools like NCEI
    Data Tools.

-   **Citing Physical Samples:** Resources like the "4 Steps to Publish Open
    Earth Science Samples AGU 2023" act as one-pagers to guide researchers on
    how to describe and reference physical samples using identifiers like IGSN
    IDs to enhance data reuse and reproducibility.

## Data desk presentation topics for experts

-   **General Data Management:** Users are often looking for a basic
    understanding of what data management entails and seek guidance on
    establishing sound data management practices for their research. They have
    broad questions about organizing, accessing, and working with their data
    effectively.
-   **Information Management:** Researchers are interested in how to effectively
    manage the information surrounding their data, including documentation,
    organization, and understanding the context of their scientific findings.
    This can involve strategies for tracking workflows and creating descriptions
    of projects from the start.
-   **Metadata:** A key area of interest is understanding metadata standards and
    learning how to create comprehensive metadata records that enhance the
    findability and reusability of their data. Users also inquire about the
    specific procedures for submitting metadata to repositories.
-   **Data Repositories:** There's significant interest in identifying
    appropriate repositories for depositing data, including various types like
    model outputs or large datasets. Users have specific questions about
    repository policies, accepted data formats, size limitations, costs, and
    available support for archiving data. Finding domain-specific repositories
    is also a common need.
-   **Ocean Data:** This topic caters to researchers working with marine science
    data who are interested in resources and best practices specific to finding,
    managing, visualizing, analyzing, and publishing oceanographic datasets.
-   **Data Visualization:** Users seek guidance on effective techniques and
    software for visualizing different types of data. They may have questions
    about specific tools or challenges in presenting their data visually, such
    as arranging elements in plots.
-   **Analysis:** Researchers are keen to learn about various data analysis
    tools and methodologies, particularly for handling and processing large or
    complex datasets. They may be interested in specific software packages or
    statistical techniques relevant to their field.
-   **Publication:** Users frequently ask about the process of publishing their
    data and software, including where to publish and how to meet the
    requirements of funders and journal publishers. Understanding open access
    options and associated fees is also a point of inquiry.
-   **R:** There is strong interest in leveraging the R programming language for
    various data-related tasks, such as data cleaning, manipulation, statistical
    analysis, and generating reproducible research. Users also look for
    resources tailored for R users in scientific contexts.
-   **R Studio:** For users familiar with R, presentations on leveraging the R
    Studio integrated development environment for enhanced productivity in data
    analysis, visualization, and report generation would be valuable.
-   **Python:** Similar to R, researchers want to learn how to use Python for
    data management, analysis, visualization, and potentially for developing
    shareable software. Resources and best practices for using Python in
    scientific workflows are relevant.
-   **GIS:** Users working with geospatial data are interested in understanding
    best practices for storing and managing GIS data formats like .shp and
    .geojson, as well as identifying nonproprietary alternatives for better
    interoperability.
-   **Satellite-dervied Data:** This topic likely attracts users who work with
    satellite-derived data and are interested in how to access, process,
    analyze, and visualize this specific type of Earth observation data.
-   **NOAA Data:** Researchers who utilize data from the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) would be interested in presentations
    covering how to find, access, and work with various NOAA datasets and
    resources.
-   **Data management:** Reinforcing the foundational aspect, this topic would
    cover core principles and best practices in data management, addressing
    questions about organization, accessibility, preservation, and overall data
    lifecycle management. Many users, especially those with little formal
    training, need basic awareness in this area.
-   **Git and Gitlab/Hub:** Researchers are increasingly interested in using
    version control systems like Git and platforms like GitLab and GitHub for
    managing their code and data, fostering collaboration, and ensuring
    reproducibility in their research workflows.

    design and implement efficient and reproducible workflows for processing
    their data, potentially utilizing scripting languages and tools for creating
    automated pipelines.
-   **Functional programming:** For more advanced users, presentations on
    applying functional programming concepts and techniques in languages like R
    or Python for cleaner, more modular, and potentially more efficient data
    analysis could be of interest.
-   **Community Management:** Some researchers are interested in learning how to
    engage with broader open science communities and initiatives, including
    contributing to projects, collaborating with others, and staying informed
    about advancements in data sharing and management practices.
