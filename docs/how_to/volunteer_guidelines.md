# Create Volunteer Guidelines

## TODO: copy content from google doc into this web page

Support your volunteers by writing out guidelines and tips to help them prepare
and contribute. The guidelines can encourage volunteers to tell others about the
event and provide more guidance on how to prepare to answer questions and what
types of information to include in one-pagers or and brief recordings. It should
serve as the main place to link to any other relevant resources to aid in their
participation. This document should also include a link to a code of conduct
that applies to their participation in the event. See example volunteer
guidelines available here. (???)

Develop **Volunteer Guidelines** that clarify opportunities and expectations for
volunteers.

## Example Volunteer Guidelines

Volunteer satisfaction is important - we want volunteers to feel like their time
was well

spent and that they would like to participate in subsequent years. Being able to
track views

or use of their resources during the event or likely as a result of their event
is one way to

show this value.

Additionally, it is good to try to be as inclusive as possible both with respect
to volunteers

and with respect to inviting questions from researchers. Careful thought should
be given

to creating a welcoming environment both in-person and virtually.

Answer earth science data & software questions virtually (monitor Twitter and/or
Slack and answer where you can);

Suggest a question and answer or related resource that you think will help Earth
Science researchers with a common data or software challenge (i.e., like an FAQ
entry);

#### **Student & researcher volunteers needed to staff data help desk**

Diversity of volunteers to staff the Help Desk, both in terms of organizations
and topics represented. This is helpful because researcher questions can vary
widely.

volunteers can be from a range of educational experience
