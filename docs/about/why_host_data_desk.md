# Why Host a Data Help Desk?

Organizations host data help desks because there is a significant need for such
a service within the research community. Many researchers, regardless of career
stage, have little or no formal training in research data management. They often
acquire data-related skills informally on their own. However, meeting increasing
expectations from publishers or funders for open and FAIR data and software
requires specialized knowledge. A data help desk directly addresses this gap in
training and provides necessary assistance. It is a way to integrate data
management practices and resources at scientific meetings.

A data help desk is fundamentally a service that provides researchers with the
opportunity to engage with experts and volunteers with knowledge about various
data concerns. The primary goal is to help people learn skills and techniques
that will improve their research and assist in making their data and software
open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

By hosting a data help desk, organizations like ESIP, AGU, or others involved in
Earth science informatics and open science can accomplish several key
objectives:

-   **Address Community Needs:** The help desk highlights the specific areas
    where the community needs support, such as acquiring, cleaning, archiving,
    and citing data, understanding FAIR principles, and working with
    reproducible workflows. It acts as a low-barrier entry point for researchers
    seeking to improve their data management practices.
-   **Disseminate Knowledge and Resources:** It provides a venue to disseminate
    valuable resources, tools, and workflows to a wide audience. This can
    include demonstrating tools, sharing information on data repositories, or
    explaining concepts like data management plans.
-   **Gather Insights for Service Improvement:** Observing and assessing the
    questions asked provides valuable insights into users' needs and informs
    future data products, tools, services, and training. This understanding can
    improve existing services and help anticipate user needs for the usability
    design of other data products and tools. Transaction analysis also offers
    feedback on how to improve the question and answering process itself.
-   **Inform Staffing Models:** The data collected from interactions can help
    inform a staffing model for future information services for science data,
    potentially including year-round services like chat or email assistance.
-   **Increase Visibility and Promote Initiatives:** Hosting the help desk,
    especially at a prominent location like an exhibit hall, increases the
    visibility of the organizing entities and their commitment to open science
    and FAIR data. It allows them to promote their programs and resources.
-   **Support and Engage Volunteers:** While requiring effort, providing a venue
    for experts to volunteer allows them to share their knowledge and resources.
    Ensuring volunteers feel their time was well spent is important for their
    future participation. The help desk provides a structured way for experts to
    contribute to the community.

## Key Needs of Hosting a Data Help Desk

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. **A dedicated core organizing team**
A group responsible for planning,
   coordinating, and executing all aspects of the Data Help Desk.
1. **Domain experts**
Staff with specialized knowledge in relevant scientific
   fields who can provide credible and targeted support to researchers.
1. **Diverse volunteers**
Contributors from a range of organizational and
   disciplinary backgrounds who bring varied expertise to the help desk.

A plan to promote the help desk through
   web content, social media, and conference presentations. This includes having
   a clearly marked and visible location at the venue.
1. **Available resources**
A collection of materials such as handouts, flyers,
   slide decks, and asynchronous content like recorded demos and tutorials.
1. **Demonstration of tools and platforms**
Live or recorded sessions that
   showcase relevant tools and workflows researchers can use to improve data
   management and research outcomes.

Guidance for researchers on a wide
   range of data issues, including finding, sharing, analyzing, publishing,
   citing, and archiving data and software.
1. **Education on FAIR principles**
Information and support to help researchers
   understand and implement FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
   Reusable) data principles in their work.
1. **Promotion of open science practices**

   researchers meet expectations for open data and software, often in
   collaboration with Open Science Pavilions at conferences.
1. **Guidance on data management**
Support with creating data management plans,
   choosing repositories, managing metadata, and citing data appropriately.
1. **Opportunities for expert connection**
A venue for researchers to engage
   directly with data professionals for tailored advice and collaboration.
1. **Response to community needs**
An approach that identifies and addresses the
   most pressing data challenges in the research community, such as cleaning,
   archiving, and citing data.
1. **Support for all knowledge levels**
