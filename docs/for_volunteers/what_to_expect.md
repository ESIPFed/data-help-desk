# What to Expect

You don't have to know all the answers to questions asked because you will be
provided with resources to point users towards. Even informing users what they
can gain and learn from a data help desk is helpful in itself.

Having a diversity of volunteers in terms of organizations and topics is
valuable Often the help desk is about providing a lead rather than a definitive
answer. This is why having a diversity of volunteers in terms of organizations
and topics is valuable. This makes a range of knowledge bases available and
beneficial to users.

## Benefits of volunteering

1. Some benefits of volunteering at a data help desk are meeting new and
   familiar faces at the event. This is a way for those early in their careers
   to expand their network and understanding of community needs.
1. Volunteering at a data help desk allows one to gain valuable experience and
   build connections, even if they don't consider themselves experts.
1. Emerging professionals (current Master's and PhD students) and early career
   researchers will be able to interact with each other and established
   researchers.
1. Helping at a data help desk is also a home base for meeting people at the
   event because they will know where to find you.
1. You will be learning from fellow volunteers staffing the desk and data
   experts giving talks and demonstrations at the desk, interacting with
   students and researchers in your field to learn about the range of data
   needs, and hearing the types of questions researchers are asking right now.

## Different ways to participate

There are various ways for people to volunteer based on their comfort level and
availability.

1. Answering data and software questions in person at the booth when available
   during the event.
1. Showcasing demos, tutorials, and resources at the booth to showcase specific
   skills or tools.
1. Answering questions virtually (monitoring platforms like Twitter, Slack, or a
   survey form) for those are more comfortable with digital interactions. This
   allows individuals with varying levels of expertise to contribute where they
   feel most comfortable.
1. Suggesting questions and answers for online FAQs or resource knowledge base
   which can be a lower-barrier entry point for those less experienced in direct
   Q\&A.
1. Contributing recorded demos or one-pagers for an online resource gallery,
   allowing individuals to share their knowledge without real-time interaction.

## Staffing the Desk

You will be expected to staff the desk or monitor platforms for scheduled time
slots, often 1-2 hours.

-   You will be at the booth in the exhibit hall or similar location. This may
    involve giving demos of tools or resources, possibly at the main booth or a
    nearby kiosk. Handouts and stickers may be available.
-   You might be monitoring designated online platforms, such as BlueSky (using
    the event hashtag like #DataHelpDesk) and/or a Slack channel, to identify
    and respond to questions. You can respond via your personal or an
    organizational BlueSky account.
-   You will should be with a schedule beforehand.

## Preparation and Support

Organizers of a data help desk focus on creating a welcoming and inclusive
environment. The atmosphere for volunteers will be supportive and
non-intimidating, regardless of a volunteer's experience level.

1. Organizers will provide you with Volunteer Guidelines and tips to help you
   prepare. These guidelines clarify opportunities and expectations and should
   include a link to a code of conduct.
1. You may receive orientation or training, which can include basic information
   about the organizing entities (like ESIP) and fundamental data management
   concepts, especially since many users are new to the topic.
1. You will be provided with a list of resources and potential questions ahead
   of time.
1. Reminders about staffing time slots and encouragement from organizers are
   part of the support.

## Read the provided guidelines clarifying what to expect when volunteering

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. The guidelines should clarify opportunities and expectations,
   provide guidance on preparing to answer questions and contributing resources,
   and include a link to a code of conduct.
1. Volunteers can contribute even if they are only familiar with using
   specific resources or projects, not just those they directly work on. This
   acknowledges that a range of perspectives and levels of expertise can be
   valuable.
1. Implement a question referral system where volunteers who
   are unsure of an answer can refer questions to more specialized experts. This
   allows volunteers with less in-depth knowledge to still contribute by
   connecting users with the right resources. The #datahelpdesk-experts Slack
   channel can facilitate this backchannel communication.
1. Offer clear volunteer guidelines
   that explain the different ways to contribute and provide support. Emphasize
   that it's okay not to know every answer and that the goal is to help guide
   researchers. Offer orientation webinars to ensure everyone is prepared.
1. Be transparent about
   the level of commitment required for different volunteer roles. This allows
   individuals to choose roles that align with their availability and comfort
   level.

## Interacting with Users

You will engage directly with researchers, who may be students, postdocs, early
career, or established professionals. Many people that come up to a data help
desk may have little to no formal training in research data management, so any
help you give will be appreciated by users.

Data help desk organizers will help volunteers prepare for talking to strangers.

1. You should be approachable, show interest in the questions asked, and
   practice active listening and clarification to determine the true question
   being asked.
1. Volunteers should share their science expertise to find commonalities and
   establish trust.
1. It is important to avoid talking down to researchers.
1. Researchers may not always ask questions initially, so there's a need to
   create buzz and share resources proactively. You might use prepared questions
   to engage passers-by at a physical booth.

## Answering and Referring User Questions

You will be answering data and software-related questions. However, you are not
expected to know everything.

1. If you receive a question you cannot answer, don't panic. You should record
   the question (or have the researcher record it) on provided sign-in sheets.
   Organizers will follow up on these questions after the event.
1. For complex questions or those outside your expertise, you can use
   backchannel communication channels, such as a Slack channel, to crowdsource
   answers from other experts or refer the user to a more appropriate expert.
1. The help desk often aims to provide a lead or guidance rather than a
   complete, exhaustive answer. Follow-up is important, ensuring users leave
   with contact information or have questions addressed later.

## Knowledge about Questions

Be prepared as much as you can to answer questions on a wide range of
data-related topics.

1. You will likely be provided with a list of potential questions and resources
   beforehand.
1. Common questions include where to find or deposit certain types of data, how
   to create a data management plan (DMP), how to cite data or software, what
   FAIR principles mean, how to handle large datasets, and questions about
   relevant organizations.
1. Some questions might be vague or uncategorized, reflecting a need for a
   broader, preliminary consultation. You should understand the why of sound
   data management practices, like making data open and FAIR, are important.

## Contributing Content

Beyond answering live questions and giving demonstrations, you might be asked to
contribute content before or during the event, such as suggesting questions and
answers for FAQs or creating recorded demos or one-pagers for an online resource
gallery.

## Providing Post-event Evaluation and Feedback

You might be asked to provide feedback through a post-event volunteer survey on
what worked well and what could be improved. Notes on your interactions might be
collected (anonymized) to analyze question types and inform future efforts.
Ensuring volunteers feel their time was well spent is important for future
participation.
