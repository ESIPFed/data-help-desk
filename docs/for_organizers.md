## What to Expect

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. **Organizing/Planning a Data Help Desk**
    - Hosting a data help desk takes a lot of planning which must start at least 2 to 3
    months before-hand. As part of the planning, form an organizing committee to
    develop an overarching vision and plan for the data help desk such as key topics
    and scope in order to prepare volunteers staffing the desk and interacting with
    users and to recruit experts to give demonstrations and answer questions. See
    the [step-by-step planning section]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/for_organizers/step_by_step_planning.md %})

2. **Advertising the Data Help Desk**
    - Create an advertising plan for before and during the event. his
    includes presence on the meeting website, potential mention in emails,
    leveraging ambassadors (section chairs, presenters), and active social media
    (Twitter) promotion. And at the desk, provide physical informational content in the form of flyers, handouts, and postcards and swag such as candy and stickers.

3. **Recruiting Volunteers and Experts**
    - Aim for a diversity of volunteers in terms of organizations and topics
represented. Volunteers should ideally be involved in various aspects of the
data life cycle. Consider recruiting students, researchers, and experts.

4. **Gather content to present and reference**
    - Gather content such as answers to common questions and locations of resources. A starter set pf question topics and answers is invaluable to the data help desk volunteers. And create a list of resources to reference at the desk and to hand out.

5. **Implement an Internal Communication Plan**
    - Create a communication plan for volunteers and experts both before, during and after the meeting. This includes emails, social media, slack channels, etc. along with providing scheduling to be at the desk and for presentations.

6. **Follow-up and Evaluation**
    - Follow up on unanswered questions that were gathered during the meeting. Evaluate transaction notes,
    survey responses (from users and volunteers), and attendance metrics. Gather feedback from volunteers and experts to see what can be improved in the future.
