# What to Expect

The host of a data help desk takes on a multifaceted role involving significant
planning, execution, and follow-up. Here's what a host can expect to do and
prepare for:

## Planning and Preparation

-   **Form an Organizing Committee**. A core group of dedicated organizers and a
    small committee are essential.
-   **Develop an Overarching Vision and Plan**. Planning should ideally start at
    least 2 months out from the event.
-   **Establish Relationships and Clarify Roles** with major sponsors, the
    meeting organization, and other contributing organizations. Determine
    possible levels of involvement and how acknowledgment will be given.
    Establish key contacts at the meeting organization to assist with promotion
    and placement.
-   **Decide on Key Topics and Scope**. Identify the general data topics the
    desk will cover, such as General Data Management, Metadata, Data
    Repositories, Programming, Data Publication, Data Visualization, Data
    Analysis, and Data Management Plans. If the event has a domain focus, engage
    organizers who are experts in that area.
-   **Determine the Location**. Find an ideal placement within the venue (like
    the Exhibit Hall) and plan for clear, attractive signage.

## Advertising

-   **Develop a Solid Communication Plan** for before and during the event. This
    includes presence on the meeting website, potential mention in emails,
    leveraging ambassadors (section chairs, presenters), and active social media
    (Twitter) promotion.
-   **Advertise the Event** prominently on the meeting website and through other
    channels, emphasizing the opportunity to engage with experts and learn about
    data management and FAIR principles.
-   **Prepare Physical Materials** Some materials include a table, signage,
    monitors for demos, handouts, flyers, and stickers.

## Recruit and support help desk personnel

-   **Recruit Volunteers and Experts**. This can be done through mailing lists,
    ESIP channels, inviting past volunteers. For smaller events, hand-picking
    experts may be best. Aim for a diversity of volunteers in terms of
    organizations and topics represented. Create a Volunteer Form for
    recruitment
-   **Onboard Staff** by providing information about the organizing entities,
    basic data management concepts, and guidelines for interacting with
    attendees. Training webinars or short videos ("b-roll") can be helpful.
    Provide a list of potential questions and resources. Remind and encourage
    volunteers, providing deadlines and support.
-   **Schedule Demos, Talks, and One-Pagers**. Consider hosting "workshops" on
    key topics, though these require significant planning effort ("heaviest
    lift"). For virtual events, creating recorded resources instead can be
    valuable due to potentially lower live attendance.
-   **Develop Volunteer Guidelines**. These guidelines should clarify
    opportunities (answering questions virtually/in-person, suggesting Q&A,
    contributing resources, staffing the booth), provide tips for preparation,
    guidance on contributing content, and link to a code of conduct.
-   **Set up Communication Channels for Volunteers and Experts**, such as a
    Slack channel for backchannel conversation and crowdsourcing answers.
-   **Ensure Volunteers Practice Good Communication**, including being
    approachable, showing interest, listening, clarifying questions, and
    planning for follow-up. Experts should share their science expertise to find
    commonalities and establish trust. They should avoid talking down to
    researchers and explain _why_ sound data management practices are important.

## Gather content to present and reference

-   **Solicit Content Before the Conference**. Gather specific answers to common
    questions, locations of resources (data, software, analysis), and references
    to knowledgeable people.
-   **Create a Starter Set of Question Topics and Answers**. Identify a list of
    user topics that volunteers may be asked about.
-   **Create a List of Resources** for various subject areas. Prepare basic
    handouts on data management, especially since many researchers lack formal
    training.
-   **Design and Compile a Gallery of Resources**, typically hosted on the event
    website, including recorded demos, tutorials, and one-pagers. Address
    challenges related to the growing size and navigability of the gallery. The
    gallery is a long-lasting and valuable output.

## Execution and Management

-   **Create Buzz and Share Resources** proactively, as researchers may not
    always ask questions initially. Use prepared questions to engage passers-by
    at a physical booth.
-   **Implement the Communication Plan**. Execute the social media plan,
    including advertising and tweeting resources using relevant hashtags.
-   **Staff the Desk or Monitor Platforms**. Ensure volunteers and experts are
    present at the physical booth or actively monitoring virtual channels.
-   **Monitor Questions** coming in from all designated forums (in-person,
    Twitter, survey form, etc.).
-   **Refer Questions to Appropriate Experts**. Use backchannel communication
    (like the Slack channel) to crowdsource answers and triage inquiries,
    especially for questions experts may be less comfortable answering publicly.
    Ensure all questions receive a response.
-   **Encourage Volunteers** and provide ongoing support. Use backchannels for
    expert collaboration.
-   **Manage the Physical Space** Ensure demos are running, handouts are
    available, and the slide deck is rotating with prompts.
-   **Collect Data from Interactions**. Provide sign-in sheets or forms for
    volunteers to record unanswered questions and user contact information for
    follow-up. Facilitate the process for volunteers to capture notes about
    transactions (e.g., using an AI assistant as done at AGU24). Offer users the
    opportunity to provide feedback via a survey after their interaction.
-   **Plan for Data Collection and Evaluation**. Facilitate the process for
    collecting information about questions asked and interactions for future
    use. Prepare survey questions for users and volunteers.

## Follow-up and Evaluation

-   **Thank Volunteers** for their participation.
-   **Follow Up on Lingering or Unanswered Questions** using the collected
    information.
-   **Collect and Analyze Evaluation Data**. This includes transaction notes,
    survey responses (from users and volunteers), and attendance metrics (number
    of people interacting). Analyze question types to identify community needs
    and dominant themes. Assess interaction quality using established
    guidelines.
-   **Survey Volunteers** to gather feedback on what worked well, what could be
    improved, and their satisfaction level.
-   **Use Findings to Inform Future Efforts**. Apply lessons learned to improve
    future data help desks, inform research data management training content and
    delivery formats, develop staffing models, and assist with the usability
    design of data products and tools. Refine the initial intake process based
    on the analysis of question types.
-   **Share Metrics and Impact** with volunteers to demonstrate the value of
    their participation and encourage future involvement.
-   **Consider Expanding Support** beyond the conference event, such as
    establishing year-round virtual services or maintaining a database of
    experts.
-   **Disseminate Lessons Learned** by sharing documentation or presentations
    with others who wish to host similar events.
