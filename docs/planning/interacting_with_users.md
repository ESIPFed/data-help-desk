# Interacting With Users

The amount of time a user interacts with a help desk can vary depending on the
complexity of their question, the type of issue they're experiencing, and the
level of support required. By following these guidelines, you can tailor your
help desk's response to meet the needs of each user and provide effective
support for managing research data. Here are some general guidelines:

## Average interaction time

1. **Simple questions**: 1-5 minutes (e.g., clarifying a process or providing
   basic information)
2. **Moderate issues**: 5 minutes to 20 minutes (e.g., troubleshooting an issue
   or resolving a problem)
3. **Complex problems**: More than 30 minutes (e.g., implementing a new solution
   or resolving a critical issue). In this case set up a future time to interact
   with an expert.

## Level of detail for answers

The level of detail required from a data help desk will depend on the user's
needs and the complexity of their question. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Basic information**: Provide a brief explanation, point to relevant
   resources, or offer general guidance (e.g., "Check our FAQs for more
   information.")
2. **Step-by-step solutions**: Offer detailed instructions, including specific
   steps and troubleshooting tips (e.g., "To resolve this issue, follow these
   steps: [insert steps].")
3. **In-depth explanations**: Provide a thorough explanation of the underlying
   concepts, principles, or technical details (e.g., "This is due to [specific
   reason]. Here's how you can fix it: [insert detailed explanation].")
4. **Customized solutions**: Develop a tailored solution based on the user's
   specific needs and constraints (e.g., "I've created a customized script to
   help you with this issue.")
5. **Technical expertise**: Provide advanced technical support, including code
   reviews, debuggings, or expert-level troubleshooting (e.g., "This is a known
   issue; I'll need to review your code to provide a fix.")

## Communication with users

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. **Clear and Concise Explanation**
   - Experts should explain concepts clearly to users. When providing answers, especially via platforms like Twitter, keeping them brief is recommended. The help desk often aims to provide a lead or guidance rather than a complete, exhaustive answer.
1. **Sharing Expertise**
   - Volunteers and experts should share their science expertise in addition to their informatics knowledge. Finding commonalities with researchers helps in establishing trust and starting conversations.
1. **Respectful and Approachable Demeanor**
   - Experts should avoid talking down to researchers. Instead, they should explain their understanding of why sound data management practices are important in a way that is relatable. Volunteers should be approachable and show genuine interest in the questions asked.
1. **Active Listening and Clarification**
   - Volunteers should practice active listening and ask clarifying questions to determine the true question being asked by the user.
1. **Helpful and Supportive**
   - The primary goal is to help users with their data-related questions. Even if a definitive answer isn't immediately available, providing a lead or directing the user to appropriate resources or experts is valuable.
1. **Follow-Up and Resource Provision**
   - Volunteers should follow up with users, ensuring they leave with the necessary contact information for further assistance or have their questions addressed later. Providing relevant resources, such as one-pagers or links to online documentation, is an important aspect of the interaction.
1. **Crowdsourcing and Collaboration**
   - Recognizing that a single volunteer or expert may not have all the answers, utilizing backchannel communication among experts (e.g., via a Slack channel) to crowdsource responses is a valuable communication strategy.
1. **Managing Expectations**
   - Since the help desk often provides an initial lead rather than a complete solution, it's important to manage user expectations and indicate if further investigation or consultation might be needed.
1. **Patience and Understanding**
   - Many researchers, particularly early career professionals and students, may have little to no formal training in research data management. Communicating with patience and understanding is crucial to effectively assist them.
1. **Clear Communication about Limitations**
   - If a question cannot be answered immediately or requires more specialized knowledge, volunteers should clearly communicate this to the user and explain the next steps, such as recording the question for follow-up by an expert.
