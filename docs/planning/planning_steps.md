long-term data stewardship.

## Overview

Setting up a data help desk involves several strategic steps that ensure
effective support for researchers and users seeking data management guidance.
Here’s a breakdown of the process:

### 1. Determine the target audience for a data help desk

Identify who will benefit from the help desk. This could include graduate
students, researchers, or staff interested in data management.

### 2. Define the Purpose and Scope

Begin by identifying the objectives of your data help desk. Understanding the
types of inquiries often encountered is crucial in shaping the help desk’s focus
and ensuring it meets the needs of users. Clearly outline the types of questions
you aim to address.

Some common questions are related to data archiving, data management, data
formats, data sharing requirements of funding agencies, FAIR data, software
available to work with data, data visualization, programming languages and
tutorials, citations, assigning DOIs, locating data, metadata creation. And
create a collection of resources.

See the resources and content section of this website for more topic areas, user
questions, and data repositiories.

### 3. Reserve dedicated space early

Reserving physical space early when holding a data help desk at a conference is
essential for several reasons. Primarily, it allows organizers to secure a
desirable location within the conference venue, such as in the Exhibit Hall
where there is often high traffic and visibility among attendees. Finding the
ideal placement and having clear and attractive signage are important
considerations for attracting researchers to the desk. Planning for the help
desk should ideally begin at least two months before the event, and this early
timeline is necessary to liaise with the meeting host organization to discuss
and book the required physical space. Reserving early also provides ample time
to plan for logistical needs such as tables, monitors for demos, and the overall
layout of the booth, ensuring that the physical space can effectively support
the help desk's activities. Furthermore, knowing the location well in advance
allows for its inclusion in promotional materials on the meeting website, in
emails to attendees, and on social media using relevant hashtags like
#DataHelpDesk and the conference hashtag (e.g., #AGU24, #EGU25), thereby
increasing awareness and encouraging participation. Some meeting host
organizations also have deadlines for requesting booth equipment and graphics,
making early space reservation a prerequisite for these processes.
