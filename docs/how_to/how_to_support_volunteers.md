# How to Support Volunteers

Hosts of a data help desk can support their volunteers in numerous ways. By
proactively offering example questions and categories, ensuring clear schedules
and reminders, and actively seeking and utilizing volunteer feedback, hosts can
create a supportive environment that enhances the effectiveness and satisfaction
of their data help desk volunteers.

## Providing Example User Questions to Prepare For

1. Hosts can provide volunteers with lists of common questions from past help
   desks. Examples of frequently asked questions include where to find or
   deposit data, how to create data management plans (DMPs), what FAIR
   principles are, how to cite datasets, and questions about data repositories
   and storage.
1. Organizers can also create a starter set of question topics, specific
   questions, and suggested answers to inform volunteers.
1. During planning, it's helpful to consider what user topics volunteers may be
   asked about.
1. Analysis of past Data Help Desks has revealed dominant themes in questions,
   such as data repositories and storage, rising interest in FAIR data, and
   challenges with large volumes of data. Sharing these insights can help
   volunteers anticipate common areas of inquiry.

## Providing Categories of Questions

1. The sources mention the creation of a data question typology based on
   questions asked at Data Help Desks, which can help in understanding the
   categories of inquiries.
1. User Question Categories are explicitly mentioned as a resource.
1. Analysis of questions from past events has shown common topics such as
   Organizations, Data Management, Sharing data, Data storage, Data analysis,
   Finding data, Accessing data, and Software. Providing these categories can
   help volunteers organize their knowledge and prepare for different types of
   questions.
1. The volunteer form for AGU 2021 asked about general data topics volunteers
   could provide help with, listing examples like General Data Management,
   Information Management, Metadata, Data Repositories, and Data Management
   Plans. This list can serve as a set of categories for volunteers to consider.

## Providing Schedules and Reminders for Staffing the Desk

1. Hosts should create a schedule for the Data Help Desk.
1. It's important to have a solid communication plan both prior to and during
   the event. This includes communicating the schedule to volunteers.
1. Remind and encourage volunteers, including deadlines and support provided via
   email just after the volunteer deadline.
1. Sending calendar invites can help volunteers keep track of their scheduled
   times.
1. During AGU24 planning, it was noted the importance of multiple phases of
   communication, including when the Data Help Desk is open, and to support and
   encourage volunteers during the meeting week once the schedule is released.
1. Volunteers for AGU24 were informed of their time slots and encouraged to
   consider the booth a home base throughout the week.

## Providing Surveys for Feedback on How to Support Volunteers in the Future

1. It is recommended to survey volunteers post-event to get their thoughts on
   what worked well and what could be improved.
1. A post-event survey can gather volunteer feedback on how the events could be
   enhanced in the future.
1. Feedback from early career volunteers at AGU24 indicated a desire for more
   hands-on training and a definitive guide. This highlights the value of such
   feedback for improving volunteer support.
1. Surveys can also ask about the benefit of staffing the desk and whether
   volunteers would want to do it again, providing insights into their
   experience and areas for improvement.
1. Collecting feedback from volunteers is crucial to understand their needs and
   enhance their experience, increasing the likelihood of their participation in
   future events.
