# How to Recruit Data Experts

No Data Help Desk can be successful without the dedication of a number of data
(and software) experts who can address researcher questions, refer researchers
to other experts, and contribute relevant resources to the resource gallery.
These experts should represent a number of different institutions and ideally be
involved in many different aspects of the data life cycle, from those who
produce and manage data to those who publish and cite. Valuable responses from
expert volunteers include not just answers to researcher questions, but also
referrals to other individuals and organizations who may be able to address
their question.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively recruit a dedicated team
of data and software experts who can significantly contribute to the success of
your data help desk by answering questions and delivering informative
presentations. Remember to clearly communicate the opportunities, provide
adequate support, and acknowledge their valuable contributions.

1. **Finding Data Experts**
    - Contact the ESIP Data Stewardship Committee
        - The ESIP Data Stewardship Committee develops and fosters practices and standards
    that ensure continued and reliable information content, quality, access to, and
    usability of Earth system science data for as long as they are deemed to be of
    value.
        - https://wiki.esipfed.org/Preservation_and_Stewardship

    - Ask in the ESIP Slack channel for expert volunteers in subjects that are topics for the data help desk.

1. **Direct and Targeted Outreach**
    -   Organizers can decide on key topics and specific resources they want
        featured and then hand-pick a set of experts in those areas. This is
        particularly effective for smaller events.
    -   Invite past volunteers who have demonstrated expertise in relevant areas.
    -   Engage the ESIP Data Stewardship Committee members, who are experts in data
        management practices and standards.
    -   Reach out to individuals identified as experts within ESIP Clusters or other
        relevant networks.
    -   Contact individuals known for their contributions to specific projects or
        resources that align with the help desk's goals.
1. **Broad Calls for Volunteers**
    -   Share a volunteer form (e.g., Google Form) through relevant mailing lists to
        solicit experts. Clearly specify the need for individuals with data and
        software expertise.
    -   Utilize ESIP communication channels such as listservs and the
        #datahelpdesk-experts Slack channel to announce the call for expert
        volunteers.
    -   Promote the volunteer opportunity on the meeting website and in any daily
        emails sent to meeting participants.
    -   Encourage section chairs and scientific session presenters to advocate for
        participation as experts.
1. **Ask for experts in topics to share knowledge**
    - Identify key topics and specific resources that organizers want featured
      and then hand-pick a set of volunteers, especially for smaller events.
      Working closely with experts prior to the event can be time-consuming but
      rewarding.
1. **Highlighting Diverse Ways to Contribute Expertise**
    -   Clearly communicate the various ways experts can participate:
        -   Answering data and software questions in person at the help desk booth.
        -   Giving demos or tutorials of tools and resources at the booth.
        -   Answering questions virtually by monitoring platforms like Twitter
            (using the #DataHelpDesk hashtag) and Slack.
        -   Suggesting questions and answers or related resources for a virtual FAQ.
        -   Contributing recorded demos or one-pagers to a virtual resource gallery.
    -   Specifically solicit experts who are willing to lead workshops or more
        in-depth side events on key data-related topics. This requires finding
        individuals with the right expertise and willingness to dedicate the time.
1. **Providing Support and Guidance for Experts**
    -   Develop volunteer guidelines for experts that offer tips for preparing to
        answer questions and creating effective demos or resources.
    -   Offer orientation webinars to ensure experts are familiar with the help
        desk's goals, procedures, and available resources.
    -   Establish a backchannel communication method (like the #datahelpdesk-experts
        Slack channel) for experts to discuss questions, share insights, and refer
        inquiries to those with more specialized knowledge.
    -   Emphasize that experts should share their science expertise as well as their
        informatics knowledge to build trust with researchers.
1. **Recognizing and Appreciating Expert Contributions**
    -   Acknowledge the contributions of volunteer experts on signage and websites,
        potentially by listing them as supporters.
    -   Share metrics of success to demonstrate the impact of their involvement.
        Tracking engagement with their contributed resources can also show value.
    -   Survey volunteers after the event to gather feedback and show that their
        opinions are valued.
