# Content regarding data

## Content for ways to manage data:

This is a broad topic, and the sources offer several insights into the specific
aspects that a data help desk could address.

-   The Data Help Desk can equip users with knowledge about **General Data
    Management**, **Information Management**, and creating **Data Management
    Plans**.
-   It can provide guidance on **best practices for archiving data in a
    repository**.
-   Volunteers can offer advice on **working with data among teams** and
    encouraging best practices like **defining sampling systems before
    fieldwork**.
-   The help desk can address questions about **data organization**.
-   Resources like the **Data Management RoadMap** outline a graduate student's
    journey through planning, collecting, assuring, describing, preserving,
    discovering, integrating, and analyzing data. This roadmap emphasizes
    getting familiar with campus librarians for guidance on information sources
    and data repositories.
-   The **GeoCAT Flyer** highlights Python ecosystem packages for analysis and
    visualization of geoscience data, showcasing a specific tool for data
    management within a domain.
-   The **USAP-DC** flyer describes a data repository for U.S. Antarctic Program
    funded research, providing a concrete way for researchers in that field to
    manage their data.
-   **Workshops** at the Data Help Desk can cover key topics like creating data
    management plans.
-   The **eODP project** aims to bring together global oceanic lithology and
    microfossil data onto a single platform, improving data management and
    accessibility.

## Content to answer why managing data is important:

The sources emphasize the benefits of good data management practices for
researchers and the broader scientific community.

-   Understanding the "why" helps users **promote these practices amongst their
    colleagues and supervisors**.
-   Good data management makes research **more reproducible, more transparent,
    and more likely to be cited**.
-   Proper data management helps researchers **receive credit when others use
    their work**.
-   It is increasingly expected by **funders and journal publishers**.
-   Effective data management can **help a researcher's career** by providing
    valuable skills sought by employers.
-   The Data Help Desk aims to help researchers make their **data and software
    open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)**,
    highlighting the importance of these principles for advancing science.
-   **Citing samples** and sharing sample metadata, a key aspect of data
    management, enables scientific discovery, ensures credit to curators, and
    enhances data reuse and reproducibility.
