# Create a Survey Form

The survey could be administered immediately after the user's interaction with
the Data Help Desk (as an exit survey), or as a follow-up after the event. For
virtual help desks, a web-based form is a suitable method. Consider keeping the
survey concise to maximize participation.

It might also be beneficial to have a brief, optional survey available _before_
the interaction to understand users' initial questions and expectations, which
could help volunteers prepare and tailor their assistance.

## How many questions to ask

Provide a form with about 5 questions on it for users to respond to.

Consider forms to submit questions in a more anonymous way (or at least not as
publicly as Twitter). This also works well if they do not have Twitter. The
questions on the form are:

### An example survey

○ Please share your question related to any aspect of Earth science data (e.g.,
finding, sharing, analyzing, publishing, and citing data). Please be as specific
as possible.

○ Name (optional)

○ Email (required)

○ Career Stage (optional)

## More questions to put on a survey form

Based on the information in the sources, a survey form for users of a data help
desk should aim to gather feedback on their experience, understand their needs,
and identify areas for improvement. Here are some questions and categories to
consider including:
