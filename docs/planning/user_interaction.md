# User Interaction

## How much time will a user interact with a help desk and how detailed should the answers be from a data help desk?

The amount of time a user interacts with a help desk can vary depending on the
complexity of their question, the type of issue they're experiencing, and the
level of support required. However, here are some general guidelines:

**Average interaction time:**

1. **Simple questions**: 5-15 minutes (e.g., clarifying a process or providing
   basic information)
2. **Moderate issues**: 30 minutes to 1 hour (e.g., troubleshooting an issue or
   resolving a problem)
3. **Complex problems**: 1-2 hours or more (e.g., implementing a new solution or
   resolving a critical issue)

**Level of detail for answers:**

The level of detail required from a data help desk will depend on the user's
needs and the complexity of their question. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Basic information**: Provide a brief explanation, point to relevant
   resources, or offer general guidance (e.g., "Check our FAQs for more
   information.")
2. **Step-by-step solutions**: Offer detailed instructions, including specific
   steps and troubleshooting tips (e.g., "To resolve this issue, follow these
   steps: [insert steps].")
3. **In-depth explanations**: Provide a thorough explanation of the underlying
   concepts, principles, or technical details (e.g., "This is due to [specific
   reason]. Here's how you can fix it: [insert detailed explanation].")
4. **Customized solutions**: Develop a tailored solution based on the user's
   specific needs and constraints (e.g., "I've created a customized script to
   help you with this issue.")
5. **Technical expertise**: Provide advanced technical support, including code
   reviews, debuggings, or expert-level troubleshooting (e.g., "This is a known
   issue; I'll need to review your code to provide a fix.")

**Best practices:**

1. **Clearly define the scope of the help desk's response**: Establish clear
   boundaries and expectations for what will be covered in the response.
2. **Use clear, concise language**: Avoid technical jargon or overly complex
   terminology that might confuse users.
3. **Provide relevant resources**: Point users to relevant documentation,
   guides, or tutorials to supplement your answers.
4. **Follow up with additional information**: If necessary, provide follow-up
   information or check-in with the user to ensure their issue is fully
   resolved.

By following these guidelines, you can tailor your help desk's response to meet
the needs of each user and provide effective support for managing research data.
