# What is a Data Help Desk?

A data help desk is essential for supporting researchers in managing their data
effectively, promoting best practices, and ensuring the long-term accessibility
and usability of research data.

The Data Help Desk specifically connects domain scientists and data experts to
share knowledge, tools, and workflows. Data Help Desks are held at various Earth
science conferences, including the American Geophysical Union (AGU), the
European Geophysical Union (EGU), American Meteorological Society (AMS), and
Geological Society of America (GSA). Often housed in the Exhibit Hall, the Data
Help Desk is led by volunteer data experts who share their time and wisdom with
students, domain scientists new to data management, and anyone interested in
learning more about leading practices in open science. Many volunteers
contribute demos, one-pagers, and recordings to help make Earth science data
more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).

Data help desks have been successfully implemented at major scientific meetings
like AGU, EGU, and ESA, illustrating that they're an effective model for
promoting good data practices in the scientific community.

In essence, the data help desk focuses on empowering researchers with the
knowledge and resources needed to effectively manage their data, embrace open
science principles, and make their research more accessible and impactful.

## A data help desk helps with

1. **Complexity of research data management**: Research datasets can be complex,
   large, and diverse, making it challenging for researchers to manage them
   effectively.
1. **Limited expertise**: Many researchers may not have the necessary expertise
   in data management, metadata standards, repository selection, or other
   related areas, leading to difficulties in sharing and preserving their data.
1. **Time-consuming and labor-intensive**: Data management tasks, such as data
   curation, annotation, and validation, can be time-consuming and
   labor-intensive, taking away from other research activities.
1. **Data sharing and collaboration**: Researchers often need to share data with
   colleagues, collaborators, or external partners, but may not know how to do
   so effectively, leading to delays or difficulties in projects.
1. **Data preservation and long-term access**: As datasets grow and evolve,
   ensuring their preservation and accessibility for future generations is
   crucial, but can be a challenge without specialized expertise.

## A data help desk provides

1. **Expert advice and guidance**: Trained staff assist researchers with data
   management issues, helping them make informed decisions about data sharing,
   repository selection, and more.
1. **Standardization and consistency**: Data help desks promote the use of
   standardized metadata standards, data formats, and repository practices,
   ensuring consistency and comparability across datasets.
1. **Efficient workflows and processes**: By streamlining data management tasks
   and providing best practices, data help desks enable researchers to work more
   efficiently and effectively.
1. **Community engagement and support**: Data help desks foster a sense of
   community among researchers, facilitating collaboration, knowledge sharing,
   and mutual support.
1. **Data curation and preservation**: By ensuring datasets are properly
   curated, validated, and preserved, data help desks contribute to the
   long-term accessibility and usability of research data.

## A data help desk can

1. **Increase researcher productivity**: By freeing up time for other research
   activities and reducing the burden of data management tasks.
1. **Improve data quality and consistency**: By promoting standardized practices
   and ensuring datasets are properly curated and validated.
1. **Enhance data sharing and collaboration**: By providing expertise and
   support in data sharing, collaboration, and repository selection.
1. **Promote data preservation and long-term access**: By ensuring datasets are
   properly preserved and made accessible for future generations.

The primary focus of a data help desk is to provide researchers with
opportunities to engage with experts who are familiar with their scientific
domain. This engagement is intended to help researchers learn about skills and
techniques that will further their research and make their data and software
more open and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

## Key aspects of a Data Help Desk

**TODO:** reorganize this and add summaries for these items.

1. A dedicated core organizing team
1. Reference desk staffed with 1-2 domain experts at a time
1. Diverse volunteers with varied organizational backgrounds and topic expertise
1. Strong communication strategy (website presence, social media, session
   presentations)
1. Central, visible location with clear signage
1. Demonstration area with experts sharing tools and resources
1. Domain expertise among staff to build trust with researchers
1. Asynchronous content availability (recorded demos, tutorials)
1. Resources of handouts/flyers and informational slides
1. **Answering Data-Related Questions:** The help desk is a place where
   researchers can ask questions about any aspect of Earth science data,
   including finding, sharing, analyzing, publishing, and citing data and
   software. This includes questions about dealing with large datasets or model
   data, and which data to archive.
1. **Promoting FAIR Principles:** A significant focus is on educating
   researchers about FAIR data principles and assisting them in making their
   research outputs FAIR. This includes explaining what FAIR means and how to
   implement these principles.
1. **Facilitating Open Science:** The help desk aims to support the ecological
   community's adoption of open science practices and help researchers meet
   publisher or funder expectations for open data and software. It operates
   within the Open Science Pavilion at some conferences.
1. **Providing Information on Data Management:** The desk offers guidance on
   various aspects of data management, such as creating data management plans,
   data citation, and finding suitable data repositories.
1. **Demonstrating Tools and Resources:** The help desk often includes
   demonstrations of relevant tools and platforms that researchers can use to
   manage their data and enhance their research. This can involve on-demand
   demos or a gallery of recorded demos and tutorials.
1. **Connecting Researchers with Experts:** It serves as a point of contact
   where researchers can connect with informatics experts and receive guidance
   tailored to their scientific domain.
1. **Addressing Community Needs:** The data help desk helps identify and address
   the data-related needs of the research community, such as acquiring,
   cleaning, archiving, and citing data, as well as understanding FAIR
   principles.
1. **Supporting Various Knowledge Levels:** Recognizing that many researchers
   have little or no formal training in research data management, the help desk
   aims to cater to various knowledge levels.
