# One-pager Ideas for a Data Help Desk

A data help desk is looking to point to any one-pagers that might help
researchers with finding, managing, visualizing, analyzing, publishing, or
citing data or software. Remember the goal of this event is to help researchers
learn about skills and techniques that will help them further their research and
make their data and software open and FAIR. The desk is also happy to share
resources that you have already made (even if they are longer than 1 page) as
long as they are within scope.

Here are some topics that have been used or suggested for one-pagers at data
help desks:

1. **Finding Data:** One-pagers on this topic aim to help researchers discover
   relevant datasets for their work. They might cover tools, platforms, and
   strategies for searching data repositories and other data sources. These
   resources could guide users on where to look for specific types of Earth
   science data.
1. **Managing Data:** These one-pagers provide guidance on best practices for
   organizing, documenting, and working with research data throughout its
   lifecycle. They can address topics like data organization, naming
   conventions, and general data management techniques.
1. **Visualizing Data:** Resources in this area focus on techniques and tools
   for effectively displaying research data. They might highlight specific
   software or methods for creating insightful visualizations.
1. **Analyzing Data:** One-pagers on data analysis can introduce researchers to
   different analytical approaches and software relevant to their domain. They
   might touch upon statistical tools or programming languages used for data
   analysis.
1. **Publishing Data:** These resources explain the process of making research
   data publicly available. They often cover where and how to publish data to
   meet funder and publisher requirements.
1. **Citing Data and Software:** A crucial topic, these one-pagers guide
   researchers on how to properly cite datasets and software in their
   publications. They might include examples of data citations and emphasize the
   importance of persistent identifiers like DOIs.
1. **Data Repositories:** One-pagers focused on data repositories provide
   information about where researchers can deposit their data. They may detail
   types of data accepted, restrictions, metadata standards, submission
   procedures, costs, and contact information for specific repositories like
   USAP-DC or the Research Data Archive at NCAR.
1. **FAIR Data Principles:** These resources explain the principles of Findable,
   Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data. They help researchers
   understand what makes data FAIR and how to implement these principles in
   their work.
1. **Data Management Plans (DMPs):** One-pagers on DMPs guide researchers
   through the process of creating effective data management plans, often
   required by funders.
1. **Specific Data Platforms and Tools:** Some one-pagers highlight specific
   resources like OpenAQ for air quality data, EarthCube resources for FAIR
   implementation, BCO-DMO for oceanographic data, and SeedMeLab as a scientific
   data management platform. Others might focus on tools like NCEI Data Tools.
1. **Citing Physical Samples:** Resources like the "4 Steps to Publish Open
   Earth Science Samples AGU 2023" act as one-pagers to guide researchers on how
   to describe and reference physical samples using identifiers like IGSN IDs to
   enhance data reuse and reproducibility.
