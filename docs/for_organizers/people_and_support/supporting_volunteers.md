# Supporting Volunteers

Hosts of a data help desk can support their volunteers in numerous ways. By
proactively offering example questions and categories, ensuring clear schedules
and reminders, and actively seeking and utilizing volunteer feedback, hosts can
create a supportive environment that enhances the effectiveness and satisfaction
of their data help desk volunteers.

## General Support

-   Ensuring that volunteers find participation to be a good and productive use
    of their time is an important undertaking because it increases the
    likelihood that they will be willing to participate again in the future.
    Constantly striving to collect and share metrics that show the event is
    having an impact can help with this. It can be helpful to survey volunteers
    post-event to get their thoughts on what worked well and what could be
    improved.
-   Because not all volunteers may be comfortable using Twitter or want to have
    to constantly monitor a Twitter feed, it is ideal to set up a separate
    mechanism for them to identify and address researcher inquiries. A Slack
    channel has been used in the past that enables discussion amongst the
    experts, as well as triaging of researcher questions. The form for
    contributing questions has even been automatically set up to post questions
    in the Slack Channel.
-   A moderator can then take expertsâ€™ responses and share them with the
    inquirer and also post the thread back to Twitter, so that others can
    benefit from the exchange. The moderator can also take questions asked on
    Twitter and post them to the Slack channel.
-   Experts can then either respond directly on Twitter or share their answers
    in Slack for the moderator to then push back out to Twitter.
-   There is the need to balance the number of question channels with the
    capacity of volunteers to monitor and respond effectively. Creating too many
    places for questions can overwhelm volunteers and lead to some inquiries
    being missed. Opt for a limited number of well-managed channels. In the
    past, a combination of one public (Twitter) and one more private (survey
    form) option has been used.
-   To support volunteers in managing questions from various channels, The use
    of a backchannel communication platform like a Slack channel can be very
    helpful. This allows experts to discuss questions, triage them, and
    coordinate responses, especially for volunteers who are less comfortable
    with public-facing platforms like Twitter. A moderator can then relay
    answers from the Slack channel back to the researcher on the original
    platform (e.g., Twitter).

## Provide Categories of Questions

1. Analysis of questions from past events has shown common topics such as
   Organizations, Data Management, Sharing data, Data storage, Data analysis,
   Finding data, Accessing data, and Software.
1. Providing these categories can help volunteers organize their knowledge and
   prepare for different types of questions.
1. Past survey forms from volunteers indicate general data topics volunteers
   could provide help with, listing examples like General Data Management,
   Information Management, Metadata, Data Repositories, and Data Management
   Plans. This list can serve as a set of categories for volunteers to consider.

## Provide Example User Questions to Prepare For

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. Hosts can provide volunteers with lists of common questions from past help
      desks. Examples of frequently asked questions include where to find or
      deposit data, how to create data management plans (DMPs), what FAIR
      principles are, how to cite datasets, and questions about data repositories
      and storage.
1. Organizers can also create a starter set of question topics, specific
      questions, and suggested answers to inform volunteers.
1. During planning, it's helpful to consider what user topics volunteers may be
      asked about.
1. Analysis of past Data Help Desks has revealed dominant themes in questions,
      such as data repositories and storage, rising interest in FAIR data, and
      challenges with large volumes of data. Sharing these insights can help
      volunteers anticipate common areas of inquiry.

## Provide Schedules and Reminders for Staffing the Desk

1. Hosts should create a schedule for the Data Help Desk.
1. It's important to have a solid communication plan both prior to and during
   the event. This includes communicating the schedule to volunteers.
1. Remind and encourage volunteers, including deadlines and support provided via
   email just after the volunteer deadline.
1. Sending calendar invites can help volunteers keep track of their scheduled
   times.
1. During AGU24 planning, it was noted the importance of multiple phases of
   communication, including when the Data Help Desk is open, and to support and
   encourage volunteers during the meeting week once the schedule is released.
1. Volunteers for AGU24 were informed of their time slots and encouraged to
   consider the booth a home base throughout the week.

## Provide Surveys for Feedback on How to Support Volunteers in the Future

1. It is recommended to survey volunteers post-event to get their thoughts on
   what worked well and what could be improved.
1. A post-event survey can gather volunteer feedback on how the events could be
   enhanced in the future.
1. Feedback from early career volunteers at AGU24 indicated a desire for more
   hands-on training and a definitive guide. This highlights the value of such
   feedback for improving volunteer support.
1. Surveys can also ask about the benefit of staffing the desk and whether
   volunteers would want to do it again, providing insights into their
   experience and areas for improvement.
1. Collecting feedback from volunteers is crucial to understand their needs and
   enhance their experience, increasing the likelihood of their participation in
   future events.
