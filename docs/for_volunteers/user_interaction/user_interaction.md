# User Interaction Overview

The amount of time a user interacts with a help desk and the level of detail
required for answers can vary depending on the complexity of their question, the
type of issue they're experiencing, and the level of support required.

## Average user interaction time

1. **Simple questions**: 1-5 minutes (e.g., clarifying a process or providing
   basic information)
2. **Moderate issues**: 5 minutes to 20 minutes (e.g., troubleshooting an issue
   or resolving a problem)
3. **Complex problems**: More than 30 minutes (e.g., implementing a new solution
   or resolving a critical issue). In this case set up a future time to interact
   with an expert.

## Level of detail for answers

The level of detail required from a data help desk will depend on the user's
needs and the complexity of their question. Here are some guidelines:

1. **Basic information**: Provide a brief explanation, point to relevant
   resources, or offer general guidance (e.g., "Check our Resources for more
   information.")
2. **Step-by-step solutions**: If you have knowledge about the user's question,
   you can give a detailed explanation, including specific steps and
   troubleshooting tips (e.g., "To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
   [insert steps].")
3. **Customized solutions**: Some users have specific domain questions that may
   not be part of resources provided. Examples are locating a data repository
   that contains specific data the user asked about. In this case, you can refer
   the user to a slack channel, a data expert, or answer the question yourself.
