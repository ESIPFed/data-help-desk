# How to Advertise the Data Help Desk

## Media plan

Generating a robust plan, including a schedule of tweets to advertise that the
event is happening, along with example questions, and featured resources is key.
The use of scheduling software like Tweetdeck or Buffer can be extremely
helpful. Having key hashtags that are used in each Tweet is important.

At a minimum, these have so far been #DataHelpDesk and the hashtag for the
associated conference (e.g., #AGU21). At some point, it may be better to have a
main Twitter account associated with the event, so that hashtags cannot be
confused with or commandeered to promote other activities and resources. This
account would need to be a shared resource amongst all Data Help Desk
organizers.

Having a twitter plan that includes numerous tweets each day drawing attention
both to the broader event and to specific topics & resources can help with this.
Tweets (and retweets) coming from numerous people and organizations using
#DataHelpDesk can be very effective and help show that the Data Help Desk is a
truly collaborative effort. Having a contact at the meeting host organization
(AGU, EGU, etc.) who is willing to retweet anything you send out can also help
reach more people.

## At the conference

Advertising not just on the meeting website, but in a prominent place.

Ambassadors – section chairs, scientific session presenters, etc., who actively
talk to others about the event during the meeting in as many places as possible
by tweeting, by sharing email advertisements, by mentioning the event in their
posters and oral presentations, town halls, and more.

## With organizations

Establish key contacts to work with advertising data help desk presence

Beyond what each organization will contribute, it is important to establish key
contacts at those organizations to work with.

With some meeting host organizations, the Virtual Data Help Desk is more closely
associated with a specific section or the Career Central component, whereas with
others it is not.

If society Y is hosting a meeting, it is important to establish who at society Y
can help with ensuring that the Data Help Desk receives prominent placement in
any digital materials, including the main meeting website.

You might also arrange with the host to have a blog post published about the
event and/or ask that they include information about the Help Desk in any daily
email reminders sent to meeting attendees.

Another key role is someone at the meeting host organization who can help with
social media coverage of your event, actively re-tweeting as you put out info.

If the entire meeting is happening virtually, you may consider discussing with
the meeting host organization whether the Virtual Data Help Desk can and should
have a presence in the virtual platform for the meeting - this can be, for
example, a virtual exhibit booth.

This can do a lot to increase the visibility of the event.

Caution should be exercised, however, when considering this option because it
creates a private space that only meeting attendees can access and it also
creates another place that data expert volunteers have to monitor.

## Steps to take to advertise you are hosting a data help desk

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. **Name and Affiliation**
    - Clearly state the name of the help desk, for example,
    "Open Science & Data Help Desk". Also, mention the organizing bodies, such
    as "a program of AGU, ESIP, and their partners". If it's associated with a
    specific event, like "during AGU24" or "at EGU25", make this prominent.
    Emphasize if it's a "Virtual Data Help Desk".
1. **When and Where**
    - Specify the dates and times of the help desk. For in-person
    events, mention the exact location, such as "Visit our booth at the Open
    Science Pavilion in the Exhibit Hall A" or "Exhibit Hall Booth #1423 within
    the Open Science Pavilion" for AGU, or "[Exhibit Booth #X208]{.mark}" for
    EGU. For virtual events, provide the online platform or link where users can
    ask questions, such as "Ask questions online here:
    https://esipfed.org/datahelp". For hybrid events, clearly state both the
    physical and virtual components.
1. **What Users Can Get Help With**
    - Clearly articulate the types of questions and
    assistance users can expect. Use phrases like "Bring your questions for our
    experts!". Provide specific examples of topics, such as:
        -   How and where to publish data or software.
        -   Where to find specific types of data.
        -   Understanding FAIR and open data principles.
        -   Writing a good data management plan.
        -   Complying with funder and publisher requirements for data and software.
        -   General data management, information management, metadata, data
            repositories, programming, data publication, data visualization, and
            data analysis. Highlight that attendees can "Engage with Informatics
            Experts" and "Learn Skills and Techniques" to "Make your Data Open and
            FAIR".
1. **Presentations/Demos**
    - If there will be scheduled demos or tutorials,
    advertise these in advance. Mention that attendees can "see demonstrations
    of relevant tools and platforms". If a schedule of experts and demos is
    available, post it online for easy access. Encourage volunteers giving demos
    to have "visually intriguing" slides to attract attention.
1. **Topic Areas and Expertise of Volunteers**
    - If possible, highlight the
    diversity of expertise available at the help desk. You could mention general
    topic areas that volunteers can provide advice on. For in-person events,
    volunteers can even say "Ask me about [fill in your data expertise]".
1. **Multiple Phases of Communication**
    - Implement a communication plan before and during the event.
        -   **Well in Advance (2+ months):** Start planning and advertising early.
        -   Leading up to the Event:
            -   Presence on Meeting Website: Ensure the help desk is prominently
                featured on the main meeting website with clear deadlines.
            -   Email Announcements: Utilize email lists and newsletters to share
                information about the help desk and encourage attendance. Consider
                asking the meeting host to include information in daily emails to
                participants.
            -   Social Media: Develop a social media plan, including suggested posts
                and relevant hashtags (e.g., #DataHelpDesk, #AGU24, #EGU25).
                Encourage volunteers to share on social media. Consider using
                scheduling software for posts.
            -   Ambassadors: Enlist section chairs and scientific session presenters
                to advocate for the help desk.
            -   Short Recordings: Encourage short video recordings from volunteers
                sharing their excitement and expertise to be shared on social media
                before the event.
        -   **During the Event:**
            -   Clear Signage: For physical locations, use clear and attractive
                signage to draw attention.
            -   Social Media Updates: Continue active posting on social media to
                remind attendees about the help desk and highlight ongoing
                activities.
            -   Announcements: Explore opportunities to have the help desk mentioned
                during scientific sessions.
1. **Targeted Outreach**
    - Consider reaching out to specific groups, such as early
    career professionals and students, as they tend to be active users of the
    Data Help Desk. You might tailor content to their interests and concerns.
    Consider contacting program managers at funding agencies to encourage their
    PIs and students to visit.
1. **Asynchronous Content**
    - Promote the availability of asynchronous content like
    recorded demos and tutorials that can be accessed at any time, especially
    for those who are busy during the meeting.
1. **Collaboration**
    - Highlight the collaborative nature of the Data Help Desk by
    mentioning participating organizations.
