# Hosting a Data Help Desk

This event connects researchers with informatics experts familiar with their
scientific domain to learn about skills and techniques that will help further
their research and make their data and software open and FAIR.

We connect Earth science researchers and data experts to enhance research and
make data and software more open and accessible.

provides researchers with opportunities to engage with informatics experts.

The Data Help Desk specifically connects domain scientists and data experts to
share knowledge, tools, and workflows.

Many volunteers contribute demos, one-pagers, and recordings to help make Earth
science data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Many
volunteers and their topics of interest are connected to the ESIP Lab and ESIP
Collaboration Areas.

## Interactions at a data help desk
