# How to Support Volunteers

Hosts of a data help desk can support their volunteers in numerous ways. By
proactively offering example questions and categories, ensuring clear schedules
and reminders, and actively seeking and utilizing volunteer feedback, hosts can
create a supportive environment that enhances the effectiveness and satisfaction
of their data help desk volunteers.

Ensuring that volunteers find participation to be a good and productive use of
their time is an important undertaking because it increases the likelihood that
they will be willing to participate again in the future. Constantly striving to
collect and share metrics that show the event is having an impact can help with
this. It can be helpful to survey volunteers post-event to get their thoughts on
what worked well and what could be improved.

Because not all volunteers may be comfortable using Twitter or want to have to
constantly monitor a Twitter feed, it is ideal to set up a separate mechanism
for them to identify and address researcher inquiries. A Slack channel has been
used in the past that enables discussion amongst the experts, as well as
triaging of researcher questions. The form for contributing questions has even
been automatically set up to post questions in the Slack Channel.

A moderator can then take expertsâ€™ responses and share them with the inquirer
and also post the thread back to Twitter, so that others can benefit from the
exchange. The moderator can also take questions asked on Twitter and post them
to the Slack channel.

Experts can then either respond directly on Twitter or share their answers in
Slack for the moderator to then push back out to Twitter.

1. **Provide Example User Questions to Prepare For**
   - Hosts can provide volunteers with lists of common questions from past help
      desks. Examples of frequently asked questions include where to find or
      deposit data, how to create data management plans (DMPs), what FAIR
      principles are, how to cite datasets, and questions about data repositories
      and storage.
   - Organizers can also create a starter set of question topics, specific
      questions, and suggested answers to inform volunteers.
   - During planning, it's helpful to consider what user topics volunteers may be
      asked about.
   - Analysis of past Data Help Desks has revealed dominant themes in questions,
      such as data repositories and storage, rising interest in FAIR data, and
      challenges with large volumes of data. Sharing these insights can help
      volunteers anticipate common areas of inquiry.
1. **Provide Categories of Questions**
   - The sources mention the creation of a data question typology based on
      questions asked at Data Help Desks, which can help in understanding the
      categories of inquiries.
   - User Question Categories are explicitly mentioned as a resource.
   - Analysis of questions from past events has shown common topics such as
      Organizations, Data Management, Sharing data, Data storage, Data analysis,
      Finding data, Accessing data, and Software. Providing these categories can
      help volunteers organize their knowledge and prepare for different types of
      questions.
   - The volunteer form for AGU 2021 asked about general data topics volunteers
      could provide help with, listing examples like General Data Management,
      Information Management, Metadata, Data Repositories, and Data Management
      Plans. This list can serve as a set of categories for volunteers to consider.
1. **Provide Schedules and Reminders for Staffing the Desk**
   - Hosts should create a schedule for the Data Help Desk.
   - It's important to have a solid communication plan both prior to and during
      the event. This includes communicating the schedule to volunteers.
   - Remind and encourage volunteers, including deadlines and support provided via
      email just after the volunteer deadline.
   - Sending calendar invites can help volunteers keep track of their scheduled
      times.
   - During AGU24 planning, it was noted the importance of multiple phases of
      communication, including when the Data Help Desk is open, and to support and
      encourage volunteers during the meeting week once the schedule is released.
   - Volunteers for AGU24 were informed of their time slots and encouraged to
      consider the booth a home base throughout the week.
1. **Provide Surveys for Feedback on How to Support Volunteers in the Future**
   - It is recommended to survey volunteers post-event to get their thoughts on
      what worked well and what could be improved.
   - A post-event survey can gather volunteer feedback on how the events could be
      enhanced in the future.
   - Feedback from early career volunteers at AGU24 indicated a desire for more
      hands-on training and a definitive guide. This highlights the value of such
      feedback for improving volunteer support.
   - Surveys can also ask about the benefit of staffing the desk and whether
      volunteers would want to do it again, providing insights into their
      experience and areas for improvement.
   - Collecting feedback from volunteers is crucial to understand their needs and
      enhance their experience, increasing the likelihood of their participation in
      future events.
