# Overview of a Data Help Desk

A data help desk is a valuable service to help researchers make their data FAIR
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

Here are the essential components and considerations for setting up a science
data help desk:

## Core Components:

1. Reference desk staffed with 1-2 domain experts at a time
2. Demonstration area with large monitor for showing tools and resources
3. Workshop space for key topics like data citation and data management plans
4. Display area for handouts/flyers and informational slides

## Key Success Factors:

1. A dedicated core organizing team
2. Diverse volunteers with varied organizational backgrounds and topic expertise
3. Strong communication strategy (website presence, social media, session
   presentations)
4. Central, visible location with clear signage
5. Reliable internet connection for demonstrations
6. Domain expertise among staff to build trust with researchers
7. Asynchronous content availability (recorded demos, tutorials)

## Critical Roles to Fill:

1. Booth Logistics Coordinator
2. Help Desk Scheduler
3. Workshop Coordinator
4. Virtual Presence Manager
5. Social Media Manager
6. Onsite Coordinator

## Common User Questions:

1. Data repository recommendations
2. Data discovery assistance
3. Information about participating organizations

# TODO: expand on this

I notice you're interested in helping the science community submit FAIR data.
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect, such as the workshop
planning for teaching FAIR principles or the expertise needed for the reference
desk staff?

The document shows these help desks have been successfully implemented at major
scientific meetings like AGU, EGU, and ESA, suggesting they're an effective
model for promoting good data practices in the scientific community.

Execute event by implementing Twitter plan, monitoring and referring questions,
and encouraging volunteers.
