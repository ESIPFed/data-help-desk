1. **Purpose and Value:**
    - A well-thought-out DMP serves as a roadmap for how
    data will be managed throughout the research lifecycle, from planning and
    collection to storage, analysis, preservation, and sharing. By proactively
    addressing these aspects, researchers can prevent significant problems down
    the line, such as data loss, disorganization, or difficulties in sharing and
    reuse.
1. **Key Components and Considerations:**
    - While specific requirements may vary
    by funder or institution, effective DMPs generally address several key
    elements
        -  **Data Collection:** The DMP should outline what data will be collected,
            the methods used, and the expected volume.
        -   **Data Formats and Standards:** Consideration should be given to the
            formats in which data will be stored to ensure long-term accessibility.
            Choosing non-proprietary and widely accepted formats is recommended.
        -   **Metadata:** The plan should detail how metadata will be created and
            managed. High-quality metadata is essential for the findability,
            understanding, and reuse of data. Researchers should consider adhering
            to community metadata standards.
        -   **Storage and Backup:** The DMP needs to specify where and how data will
            be stored securely and backed up throughout the project.
        -   **Data Sharing and Access:** The plan should outline how and when data
            will be made accessible to the broader research community, considering
            funder and publisher requirements. This includes deciding whether data
            will be made open or shareable and identifying appropriate repositories
            for data deposit. The DMP should also address any potential restrictions
            on data sharing, such as embargo periods.
        -   **Data Preservation:** The DMP should consider long-term preservation
            strategies to ensure data remains available and usable beyond the
            project's lifespan.
        -   **Roles and Responsibilities:** The plan may outline who is responsible
            for different data management tasks.
1. **Benefits Beyond Compliance:**
    - While often required by funders, creating a
    thoughtful DMP offers numerous benefits for researchers
        -  **Saves Time:** Proactive planning can prevent data-related issues that
            could consume significant time later in the research process.

    - Several resources are available to assist
    researchers in creating DMPs
        -  **DMPTool and DMPonline:** These are common tools that provide templates
            and guidance for writing data management plans.
        -   **Data Help Desks:** Experts at Data Help Desks can provide guidance and
            answer questions about creating DMPs. They can offer advice on what to
            include, point to relevant examples, and help researchers understand
            funder-specific requirements.
        -   **Institutional Libraries and Data Management Services:** Many
            universities and research organizations offer local support for data
            management planning. For example, EOL's Data Management and Services
            (DMS) works with PIs to develop DMPs.
        -   **Example Templates:** Researchers can find example DMP templates to get
            started. Many agencies like NSF, NIH, DOE, and ERC provide example DMPs
            or templates specific to their requirements. Platforms like
            [DMPTool (U.S.)](https://dmptool.org/) and
            [DMPonline (UK)](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/) have public templates and
            a list of funder requirements.
1. **Timing:**
    - Ideally, planning for data management should begin early in
    the research process, even at the proposal writing stage. This allows
    researchers to think through their data needs and management strategies
    proactively.

    - Creating a clear and logical hierarchy
    of folders (directory structure) to store data is equally important. A
    well-thought-out folder structure helps to categorize data and prevents
    researchers from spending excessive time just looking for their data before
    analysis can even begin. This structure should reflect the different stages
    of the research project, data types, or other relevant groupings.
1. **Structuring Data for Storage and Analysis:**
    - Organizing the data within
    files in a way that is suitable for analysis is another key aspect. This
    might involve using consistent formats (e.g., CSV, tabular data), clear
    headers, and avoiding unnecessary complexity within the data files
    themselves. "Tidy data" principles, where each variable forms a column, each
    observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table,
    can greatly enhance usability.
1. **Importance for Findability and Usability:**
    - The primary goal of data
    organization is to make data easily findable and usable in the future.
    Well-organized data ensures that researchers can quickly locate the specific

## Understanding and Implementing FAIR Principles {#fair}

FAIR principles are a core focus of a data help desk, given the increasing
importance of making research data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
Reusable (FAIR). Data help desks play a crucial role in explaining these
principles and providing practical guidance to researchers on how to make their
data more FAIR.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. **Explaining the Purpose and Meaning of FAIR:**
    - Many researchers, especially
    those with little to no formal training in research data management, may
    be unfamiliar with the FAIR principles. A data help desk can explain what
    FAIR and open really mean and why managing data according to these
    principles is important. This includes conveying that FAIR data supports
    open science and leads to more transparent and collaborative
    research.
1. **Addressing Common Questions about FAIR:**
    - Researchers frequently ask
    "What is FAIR?" and "What makes data and software #FAIR? And what is FAIR
    anyway?". The data help desk provides a space for them to ask these
    fundamental questions and receive clear explanations from informatics
    experts.
1. **Providing Practical Steps for Implementing FAIR:**
    - Beyond explaining the
    concepts, a data help desk offers practical guidance on how researchers
    can make their data FAIRer. This can include
    -   Directing them to resources on how to implement FAIR in their
        research.
    -   Advising on how to make their Earth science research more open and FAIR.
    -   Providing guidance on selecting FAIR-aligned repositories for
        archiving their data.
    -   Explaining the importance of assigning persistent identifiers such as
        DOIs to data and software.
    -   Offering advice on creating comprehensive metadata records to
        enhance data discovery, which is a key aspect of making data Findable.
    -   Sharing information on data standards that promote interoperability.
1. **Highlighting the Benefits of FAIR Data Practices:**
    - The data help desk can
    emphasize the advantages of adhering to FAIR principles, such as meeting
    publisher or funder expectations for open and FAIR data and software.
    They can also explain how FAIR data increases the potential for data
    reuse, enhances the impact of research through increased citations, and
    promotes collaboration.
1. **Providing Resources and Tools:**
    - Data help desks often curate and share
    resources like one-pagers, tutorials, and links to relevant
    organizations that provide further information and tools for implementing
    FAIR principles. For example, they might point researchers to the ESIP
    Data Management Training Clearinghouse for learning materials or to
    specific resources explaining FAIR.
1. **Addressing Challenges in Understanding and Implementation:**
    - The data help
    desk acknowledges that researchers may find it challenging to understand and
    implement FAIR principles. By providing direct engagement with experts,
    they can address specific concerns and provide tailored advice to overcome
    these hurdles. The high number of "uncategorized" questions received at a
    data help desk suggests that attendees often need a broader, preliminary
    consultation before diving into the technical aspects of FAIR
    implementation.
