# What is a Data Help Desk?

A Data Help Desk is a service designed to support researchers by connecting them
with data professionals who offer expert guidance on data-related challenges.
Its primary goal is to improve research productivity, enhance data quality, and
ensure the long-term usability and accessibility of datasets through tailored
support and best practices.

By engaging with domain experts, researchers gain valuable knowledge and skills
in data management, open science principles, and the FAIR framework—ensuring
their data and software are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

The Data Help Desk plays a vital role in:

-   Empowering researchers to effectively manage and share their data.
-   Promoting standardized, reproducible workflows and tools.
-   Fostering open science through education and resource sharing.

The Data Help Desk connects domain scientists with data experts to exchange
knowledge, tools, and best practices. This model has been successfully
implemented at major scientific conferences such as:

-   American Geophysical Union (AGU)
-   European Geophysical Union (EGU)
-   American Meteorological Society (AMS)
-   Geological Society of America (GSA)

## How Does It Work?

Typically located in the exhibit halls, the Data Help Desk is staffed by
volunteer professionals with data and research expertise who offer real-time
support and educational materials for a wide array of data related topics. Along
with one-on-one interactions at the data help desk, additional contributions
include:

-   Live demos
-   Informational one-pagers
-   Location of resources

An organizing committee is needed to plan and recruit volunteers to staff the
data help desk. The committee reserves space for a table at a conference or
other event for the data help desk, and optionally space for presentations and
town-hall discussions. In addition to space and personnel, there are needs for
resources to help volunteers answer questions and resources to refer users to.

## Benefits of a Data Help Desk

A well-implemented data help desk can:

-   **Boost researcher productivity**: Reduces time spent on complex data tasks,
    allowing more focus on research.
-   **Improve data quality and consistency**: Encourages use of standards and
    proper documentation.
-   **Enhance collaboration**: Facilitates data sharing and communication with
    collaborators and institutions.
-   **Support long-term data accessibility**: Helps ensure that datasets remain
    usable and accessible over time.
-   **Build research community engagement**: Encourages knowledge sharing and
    peer support among researchers.

## Reasons to Host a Data Help Desk

### Researchers Need a Data Help Desk

Researchers face numerous challenges when managing their data:

-   **Complexity and scale of datasets**: Research data can be large, diverse,
    and technically complex, requiring specialized tools and approaches.
-   **Lack of data management expertise**: Many researchers are unfamiliar with
    best practices in metadata standards, repository selection, and preservation
    strategies.
-   **Time-intensive data tasks**: Curation, annotation, validation, and other
    data management activities are often laborious and distract from core
    research.
-   **Challenges in data sharing and collaboration**: Effective data exchange
    with collaborators or institutions is often hindered by technical or
    procedural gaps.
-   **Ensuring long-term preservation and access**: Sustainable data archiving
    for future use is a critical need that many researchers find difficult to
    address alone.

### What does a Data Help Desk Provide?

Data help desks offer services to address these challenges:

-   **Expert advice and tailored support**: Domain experts guide researchers
    through data management issues, including sharing strategies and repository
    use.
-   **Efficient workflows and best practices**: Help desks recommend time-saving
    approaches and streamline data handling tasks.
-   **Standardization and improved data quality**: By promoting consistent use
    of metadata standards and formats, help desks improve data quality and
    interoperability.
-   **Support for collaboration and sharing**: Researchers receive assistance in
    effective data sharing and collaborative project workflows.
-   **Curation and long-term preservation**: Help desks provide information on
    how to properly document, validate, and preserve datasets for future use.

## Who Staffs a Data Help Desk?

Volunteers staff a data help desk and this includes students, early-career, and
established researchers. General staff volunteers help with one-on-one
interactions at the data help desk covering a range of topics. There are also
domain experts, referred to as expert volunteers, who possess specific
experience in data and various scientific domains. They are often familiar with
the specific scientific domain of the researcher they are assisting. In addition
to providing answers and guidance, domain experts at the help desk are
encouraged to share their science expertise to find common ground with
researchers and build trust. They may participate in backchannel communication
channels, such as Slack, to collaborate with other experts and crowdsource
answers or refer users. They may also contribute content like specific answers,
resource locations, or demos. These resources help researchers—especially
students and early-career scientists—understand and adopt practices that make
their data more FAIR and their research more impactful.

Staff provide expertise that covers a wide range of data-related topics relevant
to researchers, including:

-   Finding data.
-   Sharing data.
-   Analyzing data.
-   Publishing data.
-   Citing data and software.
-   Understanding and applying FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible,
    Interoperable, Reusable).
-   Creating Data Management Plans (DMPs).
-   Dealing with metadata.
-   Working with data repositories.
-   Handling large datasets or model data.
-   Addressing questions about software.
