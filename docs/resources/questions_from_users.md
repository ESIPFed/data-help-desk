# Questions From Users

The Data Help Desk has highlighted several areas where researchers frequently
seek assistance. These needs underscore the importance of ongoing efforts to
provide support and resources in these areas.

This compilation reflects the diverse needs of researchers engaging with data
and software and highlights the valuable role of Data Help Desks in providing
guidance and connecting users with relevant resources. The prevalence of
questions on data repositories, FAIR principles, and data management indicate
key areas where the community seeks support.

<a id="data-repositories-specific"></a>

### Specific Questions re Repositories

1. What types of data does your repository accept?
1. Does the archive accept data from any funding stream, or just from NSF-funded
   projects (for example)?
1. Are there any restrictions on data that are accepted (e.g., data sets > 1 TB
   can't be accommodated, or repo won't accept model output)?
1. What metadata standard does your repository use?
1. What is the procedure by which a scientist submits metadata (e.g,, via Word
   template)
1. Are there personnel at the repository who can help a scientist get their data
   and metadata archived?
1. When should a researcher engage with your repository?
1. Does your repository offer any training opportunities?
1. What license(s) does the repository support?
1. How much does it cost to deposit a dataset in your repository?

<a id="data-management"></a>

### Data Management

1. What makes data FAIR? And what is FAIR anyway?
1. Working with data among teams; encouraging best practices, defining sampling
   system before fieldwork, early adoption, IGSN
1. How to make data accessible to educators or people not in the specific field

<a id="data-citation"></a>

### Data Citation and Attribution

1. How can I cite a dataset?
1. Using data from other datasets (citing), data from different instruments
1. How do I cite my data?
1. Software citation; reducing duplication?

<a id="data-publication"></a>

### Data Publication

1. How and where can I publish my data or software?
1. What if I don't want to share my data until I've published papers on it?
1. Looking for a low-cost publication/journal for climate modelling paper?
1. Self-funded work

<a id="software"></a>

### Software

1. What kind of software do I need to share with my paper? Python packages?
1. Looking for help / policy documents to show legal team to share software
   externally
1. Sharing software publication requirements - NASA/OSTP mandate
1. Resources for code documentation
1. more resources on software documentation?
1. Should I be looking at software when I review papers? (This is difficult and
   takes time)

<a id="fair"></a>

### FAIR Principles and Open Data

1. What does FAIR really mean?
1. What is Open Science and Data?
1. What is a better definition of 'accessible' in FAIR?

<a id="data-plans"></a>

### Data Management Plans (DMPs)

1. How can I write a good data management plan (DMP)?
1. Where can I find good instructions or a form for creating a data management
   plan?

<a id="compliance"></a>

### Compliance with Funders and Publishers

1. Details of requirements and demands from funding agencies and journal
   publishers, so I can develop procedures to square those with my (FFRDC,
   defense) employer's public release approval requirements. Software is
   especially thorny!
1. All these new policies! How do I comply with my funder and publisher
   requirements for my data and software?

<a id="data-analysis"></a>

### Data Visualization and Analysis

1. Looking for resources for data visualization and geospatial analysis
1. Matplotlib: Would like to put grid lines \*behind\* data. "z order' or
   'axes-behind = True' not working"

<a id="large-datasets"></a>

### Working with Large Datasets

1. Question about who can take 15 to 20 TB of cyclonic event data going back to
   the 90s.
1. Is it ok to share processed data (which is much smaller) or do I need to
   share the raw file (very large) version?

<a id="metadata"></a>

### Metadata

1. Common questions about metadata encountered at a data help desk relate to its
   importance, standards, submission procedures, and what information to
   include. Here are some specific examples and areas of inquiry:
1. What is the definition or description of metadata? This suggests that some
   users may have a basic lack of understanding of what metadata entails.
1. Why is metadata important? When describing samples, it's important to provide
   rich metadata that describes basic characteristics. Taking time upfront to
   maximize this information will save time when reusing or sharing samples in
   the future.
1. What metadata standard does your repository use? Researchers need to know
   which standards are expected by different data repositories.
1. What is the procedure by which a scientist submits metadata (e.g., via Word
   template)? Users require practical guidance on how to actually provide
   metadata to a repository.
1. Are there personnel at the repository who can help a scientist get their data
   and metadata archived? This shows that some users need assistance with the
   technical aspects of metadata creation and submission.
1. What to document with metadata? This question highlights the need for clarity
   on the specific information that should be included as metadata.
1. What is good metadata? Consistent data formatting & descriptions help
   machines & humans better understand & reuse valuable data, emphasizing the
   role of good metadata.
