## Essential steps

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Start Planning Early**
    - Planning for a data help desk should ideally begin at least 3 months before the event. This allows sufficient time for organizing, recruiting volunteers, and advertising.
1.  **Form a Dedicated Organizing Committee**
    - It is essential to have a core
    group of dedicated organizers who meet regularly for planning and
    advertising purposes. A committee of 5-10 key
    individuals committed to the success of the event is recommended. If the
    meeting has a specific domain focus, engage organizers who are experts in
    that area.
1.  **Establish Contacts and Include in Committee**
    - Identify and work closely with key contacts at
    the meeting host organization and other contributing organizations to ensure
    prominent placement and support.
    - Have individuals of the host organization as part of the organizing committee. Having them engaged not just as contacts, but as part of the organizing data help desk committee for full buyin. Like conference organizer personnel.
1.  **Create an Internal Communication Plan for Committee**
    - A well planed data help desk succeeds when people engage within the organizing committee, so communication needs to be emphasised.
1.  **Create an Advertising Plan**
    - Develop an advetising plan
    both before and during the event.
    - 3 high value areas of advertising the data help desk event have been identified. The first two are of great importance.
        1. Have a presence on the main meeting website
        2. Mention the event in daily emails
        3. Utilize ambassadors to promote the help desk.
    - Have a presence in the program itself such as adding specific events to the meeting program. Examples are having speakers associated with the data help desk in the program such as volunteers. The volunteers want people to know they will be at the data help desk.
1. **Recruit experts and volunteers**
    - Start early to recruit personnel to give demonstrations at the data help desk and volunteers to staff it.
    - Advertise for personnel via direct emails and general recruiting via departments, interactive areas such as relevant slack channels, and social media.

## Define the purpose and scope

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Define Clear Goals, Objectives and Scope**
    -  Define what the data help desk should accomplish.
    -  What do users at the meeting need?
    -  Will the desk include software questions?
    -  Will the desk be covering a specific kind of data?,
    -  Examples are providing researchers with opportunities to engage with informatics experts,
    learn new skills, and make their data and software open and FAIR.

1. **Point of Emphasis**
    - Emphasize that the data help desk is both a place for researchers to meet with informatics experts and also a home for informatics experts to interact with each other.

1.  **Identify the Audience and Needs**
    - Determining the target audience for a data help desk involves identifying who would most benefit from its services.
    - The target audience can include researchers, early career professionals, students, and those supporting researchers.
    - Clarify the needs of the target audience which could include topics of data management training, FAIR data, software and tools, data repositories, and resources.

## Naming the Data Help Desk

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Language is important**
    -   Saying 'AGU Data Help Desk’ implies something different than ‘Data Help
        Desk at AGU conference.’
    -   As an example, don't imply it's an AGU specific help desk. Rather, say
        it is a general data help desk outside of a specific group such as the
        conference it is being held it.
1.  **Collaborative Event**
    -   The data help desk is a collaborative endeavor of many partners.
        Volunteers don't want the data help desk to be perceived as AGU created
        just because the desk is at the AGU.
    -   Be clear on who is hosting the data help desk, who the organizers are,
        and where the meeting is being held.
    -   As an example of naming clarity, if name the desk "AGU Data Help Desk",
        a collaborator such as EGU would want to be mentioned and not left out.
    -   Find out the non-negotiables if considering an organization, such as
        ESIP, to be involved or endorse the data help desk event.

## Advertise

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Promote the Data Help Desk Actively**
    -   Advertise the event not just on the meeting website but in prominent
        places. Utilize social media platforms like Twitter (using the hashtag
        #DataHelpDesk) and potentially BlueSky to announce the help desk and
        share resources. Consider reaching out to program managers at funding
        agencies to encourage participation.

1. **Identification of the Data Help Desk for Users**
    - Consider a backdrop for the data help desk to identify it to users.
    - 90% of event attendees don't know what a data help desk is and won't come to it, so you need a foothold like a banner or backdrop so a user identifies the desk and is not afraid to approach and ask questions.
    -  Having a website can also be helpful for users to find resources and see a more detailed description of the help desk.
    - If there is a data help desk website, it should be a part of the advertising.
1.  **Consider Incentivizing Participation**
    -   Explore ways to incentivize participation for both volunteers and
        attendees if possible.

## Event space

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Data Help Desk as Part of Other Events**
    -   For some meetings, the Data Help Desk is the only event, but you may
        choose to also host these other events if the resources exist to make
        them happen.
    - Data Fair can be a larger umbrella over the Data Help Desk that encompasses other events, like Town Halls and other Workshops around the general topic of FAIR and open data and software.
1.  **Secure a Location**
    -   Physical table at a conference, either provided or owned.
    -   Get a conference spot for the desk and find the
        ideal placement with meaningful signage within the physical
        venue. This can be almost as important as having the right experts present.
    - Sometimes it is best to be located in the Exhibit Hall amongst the
        flurry of activity hosted by many of the organizations that experts
        represent. Often, this is a good way to redirect people with questions
        to speak to an expert from another organization. In other cases, a more
        separate location outside of the bustle of the Exhibit Hall can be
        better.
    - Emphasize having a space to answer questions and a space to demo. Such as do you
want a forum somewhere? What ways to have people answer questions

## Recruit personnel and train

### TODO: add content on training

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Recruit a Diverse Group of Volunteers**
    -   Aim for a diversity of volunteers in terms of organizations and topics
        represented. Volunteers should ideally be involved in various aspects of
        the data life cycle. Consider recruiting students, researchers, and
        experts. Utilize volunteer forms and clearly communicate opportunities
        and expectations through volunteer guidelines.
1.  **Develop Volunteer Guidelines and Provide Support**
    -   Create volunteer guidelines and tips to help them prepare and
        contribute. These guidelines should explain how to answer questions and
        what to include in resources like one-pagers and recordings. Provide
        ongoing support to volunteers before and during the event. A Slack
        channel can facilitate backchannel conversation among experts.

## Answer user needs

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Prepare for Common Questions**
    -   Be aware of common questions asked at data help desks, such as where to
        deposit or find data, how to write data management plans, and what FAIR
        principles are. Prepare resources and talking points for these topics.

1.  **Create a Collection of Resources**
    - *TODO add text

    -   Create a gallery of contributed demos, tutorials,
        and one-pagers. These resources should primarily be short video
        recordings and one-pagers on relevant topics. Curate this gallery to
        ensure the resources are relevant and up-to-date.

## Plan user interaction

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Plan for Question Handling**
    - Design forums for researchers to ask
    questions. This could be through monitoring online
    platforms, social media, or dedicated Q&A sections. Have a Question Referrer
    who monitors these platforms and directs questions to appropriate experts.
    For unanswered questions, record them for follow-up.
1.  **Consider Offering Workshops or Demos**
    - Include demonstrations of relevant
    tools and platforms and consider offering workshops on key topics like data
    citation and data management plans.
1.  **Be Approachable**
    -   Remember that researchers may not always know what questions to ask, so
        be approachable and help them understand the scope of the data help
        desk. Share science expertise to build trust.

## After the Event

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Collect Feedback and Metrics**
    -   Plan to collect feedback from both users and volunteers through surveys
        and other methods. Track metrics of success, such as the number of
        interactions, quality of answers, and engagement with resources.
        Post-event surveys can gather valuable insights for future improvements.
1.  **Acknowledge Sponsors and Supporters**
    -   Clearly communicate who the organizing entities and further supporters
        are on signage and websites.
1.  **Plan for Post-Event Engagement**
    -   Think about ways to engage with people after the conference, such as
        collecting emails to send surveys or promote relevant Slack channels.
