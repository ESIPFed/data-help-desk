# Why a Data Help Desk is Needed

A data help desk is essential for supporting researchers in managing their data
effectively, promoting best practices, and ensuring the long-term accessibility
and usability of research data.

The mission of the Data Help Desk is to advise scientists on the landscape of
data repositories housing earth science data and to connect them to tools,
services, and skills, and to support the earth science communityâ€™s adoption of
open science practices and FAIR
[Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples)
data principles.

## A data help desk helps with

1. **Complexity of research data management**: Research datasets can be complex,
   large, and diverse, making it challenging for researchers to manage them
   effectively.
2. **Limited expertise**: Many researchers may not have the necessary expertise
   in data management, metadata standards, repository selection, or other
   related areas, leading to difficulties in sharing and preserving their data.
3. **Time-consuming and labor-intensive**: Data management tasks, such as data
   curation, annotation, and validation, can be time-consuming and
   labor-intensive, taking away from other research activities.
4. **Data sharing and collaboration**: Researchers often need to share data with
   colleagues, collaborators, or external partners, but may not know how to do
   so effectively, leading to delays or difficulties in projects.
5. **Data preservation and long-term access**: As datasets grow and evolve,
   ensuring their preservation and accessibility for future generations is
   crucial, but can be a challenge without specialized expertise.

## A data help desk provides

1. **Expert advice and guidance**: Trained staff assist researchers with data
   management issues, helping them make informed decisions about data sharing,
   repository selection, and more.
2. **Standardization and consistency**: Data help desks promote the use of
   standardized metadata standards, data formats, and repository practices,
   ensuring consistency and comparability across datasets.
3. **Efficient workflows and processes**: By streamlining data management tasks
   and providing best practices, data help desks enable researchers to work more
   efficiently and effectively.
4. **Community engagement and support**: Data help desks foster a sense of
   community among researchers, facilitating collaboration, knowledge sharing,
   and mutual support.
5. **Data curation and preservation**: By ensuring datasets are properly
   curated, validated, and preserved, data help desks contribute to the
   long-term accessibility and usability of research data.

## A data help desk can

1. **Increase researcher productivity**: By freeing up time for other research
   activities and reducing the burden of data management tasks.
2. **Improve data quality and consistency**: By promoting standardized practices
   and ensuring datasets are properly curated and validated.
3. **Enhance data sharing and collaboration**: By providing expertise and
   support in data sharing, collaboration, and repository selection.
4. **Promote data preservation and long-term access**: By ensuring datasets are
   properly preserved and made accessible for future generations.
