# How to Recruit Help Desk Volunteers

To recruit volunteers for a data help desk, organizers can employ several
strategies, as highlighted in the sources:

-   **Identify key topics and specific resources** that organizers want featured
    and then **hand-pick a set of volunteers**, especially for smaller events.
    Working closely with experts prior to the event can be time-consuming but
    rewarding.
-   **Share a volunteer form** (e.g., Google Form) with **relevant mailing
    lists** to solicit volunteers.
-   **Invite past volunteers** to participate again. Volunteer satisfaction is
    important for repeat participation.
-   Utilize **ESIP communication channels** (e.g., listservs, Slack) to recruit
    volunteers.
-   Engage **ESIP Clusters** and other relevant groups within the hosting
    organization (e.g., AGU Informatics).
-   For virtual events, volunteers do not necessarily need to be registered for
    the main meeting. This can broaden the pool of potential volunteers.
-   Clearly communicate the **different ways to participate**, which can
    include:
    -   Answering data and software questions in person at the booth.
    -   Showcasing demos or tutorials of tools or resources at the booth.
    -   Answering questions virtually (monitoring platforms like Twitter, Slack,
        or a survey form).
    -   Suggesting questions and answers for a virtual FAQ or knowledge base.
    -   Contributing recorded demos or one-pagers for a virtual resource
        gallery.
-   Develop **Volunteer Guidelines** that clarify opportunities and
    expectations, provide guidance on preparing to answer questions and
    contributing resources, and include a link to a code of conduct.
-   Remind and encourage volunteers, including deadlines and providing support
    information via email.
-   Emphasize the **benefits of volunteering**, such as meeting people involved
    in the data help desk and seeing the types of questions researchers are
    asking.
-   Consider **incentivizing participation** if resources allow.
-   Recognize the **diversity of potential volunteers**, including students,
    researchers, librarians, and individuals from institutions or departments.
    Volunteers can range from those familiar with using a resource to those who
    work on it.
-   Engage **Early Career Professionals** specifically for their insights and
    feedback.
-   Ensure a **solid communication plan** to inform potential volunteers about
    the opportunity.

To recruit people with a range of career experience and data knowledge to staff
a data help desk, you can employ several strategies based on the information in
the sources:

-   **Target a Broad Spectrum of Potential Volunteers:** Reach out to
    individuals at various career stages, including **students, postdocs, early
    career researchers, and established professionals**. Emphasize that
    volunteers do not all need to be advanced experts.
-   **Engage Different Departments and Institutions:** Recruit volunteers from
    diverse backgrounds such as **students, researchers, libraries,
    institutions, and departments**. This will naturally bring in people with
    varying levels of experience and expertise.
-   **Specifically Invite Emerging and Early Career Researchers:** Actively
    encourage the participation of **emerging professionals (current Master's
    and PhD students)** and **early career professionals**. Highlight
    opportunities for them to gain valuable experience and build connections,
    even if they don't consider themselves experts. Pair them with more
    experienced volunteers for support.
-   **Welcome Volunteers with Different Levels of Familiarity:** Explicitly
    state that volunteers can contribute even if they are **only familiar with
    using specific resources or projects**, not just those they directly work
    on. This acknowledges that a range of perspectives and levels of expertise
    can be valuable.
-   **Offer Diverse Modes of Participation:** Provide various ways for people to
    volunteer based on their comfort level and availability. This can include:
    -   **Answering questions in person** at the help desk for those with more
        confidence or availability during the event.
    -   **Sharing demos or tutorials in person** to showcase specific skills or
        tools.
    -   **Answering questions virtually** via platforms like Twitter or Slack
        for those who may not be able to attend in person or are more
        comfortable with digital interactions. This allows individuals with
        varying levels of expertise to contribute where they feel most
        comfortable.
    -   **Suggesting questions and answers** for FAQs, which can be a
        lower-barrier entry point for those less experienced in direct Q\&A.
    -   **Contributing resources** like recorded demos or one-pagers, allowing
        individuals to share their knowledge without real-time interaction.
-   **Utilize Varied Recruitment Channels:** Use a mix of communication methods
    to reach different groups:
    -   **ESIP communication channels** (listservs, Slack).
    -   **Relevant mailing lists** within specific scientific domains or
        institutions.
    -   Directly **invite past volunteers** who have already shown interest.
-   **Emphasize the Value of Diverse Perspectives:** Highlight that
    **crowdsourcing responses** and having a **diversity of volunteers** in
    terms of organizations and topics is valuable. Explain that often the help
    desk is about providing a lead rather than a definitive answer, making a
    range of knowledge bases beneficial.
-   **Establish a Question Referral System:** Implement a system where
    volunteers who are unsure of an answer can **refer questions to more
    specialized experts**. This allows volunteers with less in-depth knowledge
    to still contribute by connecting users with the right resources. The
    **#datahelpdesk-experts Slack channel** can facilitate this backchannel
    communication.
-   **Provide Volunteer Guidelines and Support:** Offer clear **volunteer
    guidelines** that explain the different ways to contribute and provide
    support. Emphasize that it's **okay not to know** every answer and that the
    goal is to help guide researchers. Offer **orientation webinars** to ensure
    everyone is prepared.
-   **Clearly Communicate Expectations and Time Commitment:** Be transparent
    about the level of commitment required for different volunteer roles. This
    allows individuals to choose roles that align with their availability and
    comfort level.
-   **Focus on Creating a Welcoming and Inclusive Environment:** Ensure that the
    atmosphere for volunteers is supportive and non-intimidating, regardless of
    their experience level. This encourages a wider range of people to
    participate.
-   **Highlight the Learning Opportunities for Volunteers:** Frame volunteering
    as a chance to **meet people involved in the data help desk** and **see what
    questions people are asking about**. This can be particularly appealing to
    those earlier in their careers who want to expand their network and
    understanding of community needs.
