# Planning a data help desk

## Organize early

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Start Planning Early**
    -   Planning for a data help desk, especially a virtual one, should ideally
        begin at least 2 months before the event. This allows sufficient time
        for organizing, recruiting volunteers, and advertising.

1.  **Form a Dedicated Organizing Committee**
    - It is essential to have a core
    group of dedicated organizers who meet regularly for planning and
    advertising purposes. For virtual events, a committee of 5-10 key
    individuals committed to the success of the event is recommended. If the
    meeting has a specific domain focus, engage organizers who are experts in
    that area.

1.  **Establish Key Contacts**
    - Identify and work closely with key contacts at
    the meeting host organization and other contributing organizations to ensure
    prominent placement and support.

1.  **Establish a Solid Communication Plan**
    - Develop a **communication plan**
    both before and during the event. This includes having a presence on the
    main meeting website, mentioning the event in daily emails, and utilizing
    ambassadors to promote the help desk.

## Define goals

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Establish Clear Goals and Objectives**
    -   Define what the data help desk should accomplish. For example, it should
    provide researchers with opportunities to engage with informatics experts,
    learn new skills, and make their data and software open and FAIR. The goals
    can also include informing future research data management training and
    staffing of information services.

1.  **Naming of the Data Help Desk**
    -   Language is important - the ‘Virtual Data Help Desk at AGU’ implies
        something different than ‘AGU Virtual Data Help Desk.’

## Event space

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Consider the Format (Virtual, In-Person, or Hybrid)**
    -   Decide whether the data help desk will be virtual, in-person, or a
        hybrid of both. While much of the planning information is useful for
        both, virtual events require a place for researchers to ask questions
        and a gallery of resources. For hybrid events, coordinate both virtual
        and physical presences.

    -   Virtual Help desk: Create a website. Consider obtaining a bit.ly link -
        e.g., bit.ly/DataHelpAGU20

    -   Hybrid Virtual and physical. For a hybrid event, the meeting host
        organization can provide guidance on whether a physical Data Help Desk
        component can and should be arranged.

    -   Physical location of desk. Getting a conference spot for desk. Finding
        the ideal placement and including meaningful signage within the physical
        venue can be almost as important as having the right experts present.
        Sometimes it is best to be located in the Exhibit Hall amongst the
        flurry of activity hosted by many of the organizations that experts
        represent. Often, this is a good way to redirect people with questions
        to speak to an expert from another organization. In other cases, a more
        separate location outside of the bustle of the Exhibit Hall can be
        better.

1.  **Data help desk as part of other events**
    -   For some meetings, the Data Help Desk is the only event, but you may
        choose to also host these other events if the resources exist to make
        them happen.

    - Data Fair can be a larger umbrella over the Data Help Desk that encompasses other events, like Town Halls and other Workshops around the general topic of FAIR and open data and software.

1.  **Secure a Location (Physical and/or Virtual)**
    -   For in-person events, get a conference spot for the desk and find the
        ideal placement with meaningful signage. Sometimes, the Exhibit Hall is
        a good location, while other times a more separate space is better. For
        virtual events, create a website for the help desk, potentially using a
        memorable link. Consider if the help desk should have a presence in the
        virtual platform of the main meeting.

## Recruit people

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Recruit a Diverse Group of Volunteers**
    -   Aim for a diversity of volunteers in terms of organizations and topics
        represented. Volunteers should ideally be involved in various aspects of
        the data life cycle. Consider recruiting students, researchers, and
        experts. Utilize volunteer forms and clearly communicate opportunities
        and expectations through volunteer guidelines.

1.  **Develop Volunteer Guidelines and Provide Support**
    -   Create volunteer guidelines and tips to help them prepare and
        contribute. These guidelines should explain how to answer questions and
        what to include in resources like one-pagers and recordings. Provide
        ongoing support to volunteers before and during the event. A Slack
        channel can facilitate backchannel conversation among experts.

## Advertise

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Promote the Data Help Desk Actively**
    -   Advertise the event not just on the meeting website but in prominent
        places. Utilize social media platforms like Twitter (using the hashtag
        #DataHelpDesk) and potentially BlueSky to announce the help desk and
        share resources. Consider reaching out to program managers at funding
        agencies to encourage participation.

1.  **Consider Incentivizing Participation**
    -   Explore ways to incentivize participation for both volunteers and
        attendees if possible.

## User needs

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Be approachable**
    -   Remember that researchers may not always know what questions to ask, so
        be approachable and help them understand the scope of the data help
        desk. Share science expertise to build trust.

1.  **Prepare for Common Questions**
    -   Be aware of common questions asked at data help desks, such as where to
        deposit or find data, how to write data management plans, and what FAIR
        principles are. Prepare resources and talking points for these topics.

1.  **Develop a Resource Gallery**
    -   For virtual events, create a gallery of contributed demos, tutorials,
        and one-pagers. These resources should primarily be short video
        recordings and one-pagers on relevant topics. Curate this gallery to
        ensure the resources are relevant and up-to-date.

## Interaction

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Plan for Question Handling**
    - Design forums for researchers to ask
    questions. For virtual events, this could be through monitoring online
    platforms, social media, or dedicated Q&A sections. Have a Question Referrer
    who monitors these platforms and directs questions to appropriate experts.
    For unanswered questions, record them for follow-up.

1.  **Consider Offering Workshops or Demos**
    - Include demonstrations of relevant
    tools and platforms and consider offering workshops on key topics like data
    citation and data management plans. Recorded resources can be valuable if
    live attendance is low for virtual meetings.

## After

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1.  **Collect Feedback and Metrics**
    -   Plan to collect feedback from both users and volunteers through surveys
        and other methods. Track metrics of success, such as the number of
        interactions, quality of answers, and engagement with resources.
        Post-event surveys can gather valuable insights for future improvements.

1.  **Acknowledge Sponsors and Supporters**
    -   Clearly communicate who the organizing entities and further supporters
        are on signage and websites.

1.  **Plan for Post-Event Engagement**
    -   Think about ways to engage with people after the conference, such as
        collecting emails to send surveys or promote relevant Slack channels.
