# Documents for Volunteers

## Volunteer Guidelines

Support your volunteers by writing out guidelines and tips to help them prepare
and contribute. The guidelines can encourage volunteers to tell others about the
event and provide more guidance on how to prepare to answer questions and what
types of information to include in one-pagers or and brief recordings. It should
serve as the main place to link to any other relevant resources to aid in their
participation. This document should also include a link to a code of conduct
that applies to their participation in the event.

Develop volunteer guidelines that clarify opportunities and expectations for
volunteers.
