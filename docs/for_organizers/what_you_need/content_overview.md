# Content for a Data Help Desk

## Content for help desk prior to conference:

This stage involves preparation to ensure the help desk is well-equipped to
assist users.

-   **Solicit content for the help desk before the conference**, considering who
    to ask and what type of content is needed.
-   **Create a starter set of question topics, specific questions, and question
    answers** to guide help desk volunteers.
-   Develop **a list of user topics** that volunteers may be asked about.
-   **Schedule demos, talks, and one-pagers** for the help desk.
-   **Create a list of resources for various subject areas**, providing relevant
    examples.
-   **Solicit asynchronous content** like recorded demos and one-pagers from
    experts, ensuring they cover key topics such as resource name, description,
    access, contact information, and funding support.
-   For repositories, specifically solicit information about data types, funding
    restrictions, size limits, metadata standards, submission procedures,
    support personnel, training, licenses, and costs.
-   **Develop Volunteer Guidelines** to clarify expectations and opportunities.
-   **Develop and share a Volunteer Form**.

## Content for help desk during conference:

This focuses on making resources and expertise available to attendees.

-   **Make content for the data help desk available**, considering what content,
    subjects, formats, and its lifetime (during or after the conference).
-   **Content can come from experts volunteering during the help desk**,
    including specific answers, locations of resources, references to
    knowledgeable people, and demos.
-   **Non-expert volunteers** can also contribute during the meeting.
-   Content created **before the conference** should be made accessible.
-   **Share asynchronous content** such as posters, talks, demos, brochures, and
    social media posts, ensuring permission to share and a plan for
    presentation. Examples of asynchronous content include **short video
    recordings, one-pagers, and tweets**. Recorded demos can have a lasting
    impact.
-   **Experts can staff the desk** to answer questions.
-   Offer **demos, workshops, and handouts**.
-   Create **virtual resource galleries**.
-   Utilize a **large monitor/area for on-demand demos**.
-   Have **space for handouts/flyers and a small monitor with a rotating
    slidedeck** featuring useful prompts and information.

## Content from help desk after conference (Ephemeral or archived):

This considers the lifespan and future availability of the help desk's
outputs. - Content can be **ephemeral**, existing only during the conference. -
Content can also be **archived** for future use. - **Asynchronous content like
recorded demos can have a lasting impact** beyond the conference. - Consider
having a service **year-round** where scientists can ask data management
questions, similar to library services. This could involve a database of expert
contacts. - **Findings from the Data Help Desk** can be disseminated through
webinars and reports to data-related communities. - The **virtual resource
gallery** can serve as an archive of helpful materials. However, organizers
should consider how to best present and curate this growing collection to ensure
navigability.
