# Recruiting Volunteers for a Data Help Desk

It's important to have a diversity of volunteers from a range of educational
experience to staff the Help Desk, both in terms of organizations and topics
represented. This is helpful because researcher questions can vary widely. To
recruit people with a range of career experience and data knowledge to staff a
data help desk, you can employ several strategies.

## Emphasize the benefits of volunteering

1. Emphasize the benefits of volunteering, such as meeting people involved in
   the data help desk and seeing the types of questions researchers are asking.
1. Specifically Invite Emerging and Early Career Researchers: Actively encourage
   the participation of emerging professionals (current Master's and PhD
   students) and early career professionals. Highlight opportunities for them to
   gain valuable experience and build connections, even if they don't consider
   themselves experts. Pair them with more experienced volunteers for support.
1. Emphasize the Value of Diverse Perspectives: Highlight that crowdsourcing
   responses and having a diversity of volunteers in terms of organizations and
   topics is valuable. Explain that often the help desk is about providing a
   lead rather than a definitive answer, making a range of knowledge bases
   beneficial.
1. Highlight the Learning Opportunities for Volunteers: Frame volunteering as a
   chance to meet people involved in the data help desk and see what questions
   people are asking about. This can be particularly appealing to those earlier
   in their careers who want to expand their network and understanding of
   community needs.

## List the different ways to participate

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. Answering data and software questions in person at the booth.
1. Showcasing demos or tutorials of tools or resources at the booth.
1. Answering questions virtually (monitoring platforms like Twitter, Slack, or
    a survey form).
1. Suggesting questions and answers for a virtual FAQ or knowledge base.
1. Contributing recorded demos or one-pagers for a virtual resource gallery.
1. Offer Diverse Modes of Participation: Provide various ways for people to
    volunteer based on their comfort level and availability. This can include:
    -   Answering questions in person at the help desk for those with more
        confidence or availability during the event.
    -   Sharing demos or tutorials in person to showcase specific skills or
        tools.
    -   Answering questions virtually via platforms like Twitter or Slack for
        those who may not be able to attend in person or are more comfortable
        with digital interactions. This allows individuals with varying levels
        of expertise to contribute where they feel most comfortable.
    -   Suggesting questions and answers for FAQs, which can be a lower-barrier
        entry point for those less experienced in direct Q\&A.
    -   Contributing resources like recorded demos or one-pagers, allowing
        individuals to share their knowledge without real-time interaction.

## How to advertise for volunteers

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. Share a volunteer form (e.g., Google Form) with relevant mailing lists to
    solicit volunteers.
1. Utilize ESIP communication channels (e.g., listservs, Slack) to recruit
    volunteers.
1. Invite past volunteers to participate again. Volunteer satisfaction is
    important for repeat participation.
1. Utilize Varied Recruitment Channels: Use a mix of communication methods to
    reach different groups:
    -   ESIP communication channels (listservs, Slack).
    -   Relevant mailing lists within specific scientific domains or
        institutions.
    -   Directly invite past volunteers who have already shown interest.

## Where to recruit volunteers

1. Recognize the diversity of potential volunteers, including students,
   researchers, librarians, and individuals from institutions or departments.
   Volunteers can range from those familiar with using a resource to those who
   work on it.
1. Target a Broad Spectrum of Potential Volunteers: Reach out to individuals at
   various career stages, including students, postdocs, early career
   researchers, and established professionals. Emphasize that volunteers do not
   all need to be advanced experts.
1. Engage Different Departments and Institutions: Recruit volunteers from
   diverse backgrounds such as students, researchers, libraries, institutions,
   and departments. This will naturally bring in people with varying levels of
   experience and expertise.
1. Engage Early Career Professionals specifically for their insights and
   feedback.
1. Engage ESIP Clusters and other relevant groups within the hosting
   organization (e.g., AGU Informatics).
1. Ensure a solid communication plan to inform potential volunteers about the
   opportunity.
1. For virtual events, volunteers do not necessarily need to be registered for
   the main meeting. This can broaden the pool of potential volunteers.

## Devlop guidelines clarifying what to expect when volunteering

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
1. **Develop Volunteer Guidelines**
   - The guidelines should clarify opportunities and expectations,
   provide guidance on preparing to answer questions and contributing resources,
   and include a link to a code of conduct.
1. **Welcome Volunteers with Different Levels of Familiarity**
   - Explicitly state
   that volunteers can contribute even if they are only familiar with using
   specific resources or projects, not just those they directly work on. This
   acknowledges that a range of perspectives and levels of expertise can be
   valuable.
1. **Establish a Question Referral System**
   - Implement a system where volunteers who
   are unsure of an answer can refer questions to more specialized experts. This
   allows volunteers with less in-depth knowledge to still contribute by
   connecting users with the right resources. The #datahelpdesk-experts Slack
   channel can facilitate this backchannel communication.
1. **Provide Volunteer Guidelines and Support**
   - Offer clear volunteer guidelines
   that explain the different ways to contribute and provide support. Emphasize
   that it's okay not to know every answer and that the goal is to help guide
   researchers. Offer orientation webinars to ensure everyone is prepared.
1. **Clearly Communicate Expectations and Time Commitment**
   - Be transparent about
   the level of commitment required for different volunteer roles. This allows
   individuals to choose roles that align with their availability and comfort
   level.

## Encourage volunteers

1. Remind and encourage volunteers, including deadlines and providing support
   information via email.
1. Consider incentivizing participation if resources allow.
1. Focus on Creating a Welcoming and Inclusive Environment: Ensure that the
   atmosphere for volunteers is supportive and non-intimidating, regardless of
   their experience level. This encourages a wider range of people to
   participate.
